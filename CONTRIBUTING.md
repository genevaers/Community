#Contributing to GenevaERS

Each source file must include a license header for the Apache Software License 2.0. Using the SPDX format is the simplest approach. e.g.

` /*`
`  Copyright <holder> <year>`
` `
`  SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
`
`  */`

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the same approach - the Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO) - that the Linux® Kernel community uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your local git repository using the following command:

`git commit -s`
