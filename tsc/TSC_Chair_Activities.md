# TSC Chair Activites

The Technical Steering Committee is the highest governing body for the GenevaERS project.  

In May 2022 the project voted to limit service as the chair to two year maximum, and that the vice chair would be promoted to chair.  Since the project was launched in July 2020, the chair would typically rotate in July.
