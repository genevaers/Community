00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.890
bobmcCormack: No sign of a and these up for the

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.610
bobmcCormack: Opening the office next month, unfortunately.

18
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.030
Ian: Yeah I don't know what's going on there.

19
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.360
bobmcCormack: Yeah, that's a two week. So why they say the second November.

20
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:52.650
Ian: Hey,

21
00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:56.550
Randall Ness: Hello.

22
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:00.270
Randall Ness: Hey, Bob.

23
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:02.970
bobmcCormack: brown eyed and bushy tailed night.

24
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.020
All right.

25
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.020
Randall Ness: I was happy to see that Eugene's on demand.

26
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.450
bobmcCormack: Yeah yeah

27
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:57.990
bobmcCormack: Yeah, the scare and unfortunately it with all the science in the world. They couldn't pin it down so but there doesn't seem to be anything at the plumbing seems to be okay. That's the main thing.

28
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:15.630
bobmcCormack: And it was a cardiac event because the blood showed slight damage to the heart. So that enzyme gets pulled out. So there was a. It wasn't a fake or a false event so

29
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:18.390
Yeah.

30
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.610
Randall Ness: Hope you take next and easy.

31
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.950
bobmcCormack: He was texted me this morning. He's gone for another long bike ride you feeling drive

32
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.250
Here.

33
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.130
andrea orth: He was slacking a couple hours ago.

34
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.040
I'm texting him now.

35
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.530
Randall Ness: So Andrea, you're in charge today is that right

36
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.020
andrea orth: Yeah yeah

37
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:15.690
andrea orth: Do you have an agenda. No, I think that's going to be the first thing I talked about, I think that the schedule for the scheduler needs updated and I'm not sure where that happens because I was looking at run results for that get lab actions.

38
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.850
Kip Twitchell: On near my apologies apologize for being late.

39
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.060
Kip Twitchell: Thanks for starting without me.

40
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.310
andrea orth: Well we barely just started

41
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:27.150
Good.

42
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.160
andrea orth: So Agenda Item Number one is we don't have an agenda.

43
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:40.710
andrea orth: It looks like when we move the date, whatever. What's the schedule for that. Get up, get up, get up, action.

44
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:52.110
andrea orth: And I'm not sure where that schedule is I was looking at the before this meeting started I was looking at the run results.

45
00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:01.650
andrea orth: To the latest GitHub action and it references a schedule, but I don't know where it's pulling that in from

46
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.370
Kip Twitchell: You know, it's not very intuitive. Is it

47
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.880
andrea orth: No, it's not intuitive.

48
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:16.500
Kip Twitchell: I felt I felt very fortunate to have been able to change the event time. But other than that, that was

49
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.720
Kip Twitchell: Well,

50
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:37.140
Kip Twitchell: Andrew, what if we dropped back to the TLC meeting minutes from last time to give us some structure.

51
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.080
andrea orth: We can

52
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.750
andrea orth: We also have a couple

53
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.570
andrea orth: Like I put a couple items out there and it looked like Bob had something to

54
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:58.320
Sandy Peresie: You can always look at the at the issues and the different repositories and go through them that like to

55
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.600
Sandy Peresie: Think that was part of the agenda for today.

56
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.000
andrea orth: I believe it was

57
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:13.890
Kip Twitchell: And I'm supposed to take minutes

58
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:15.930
andrea orth: Yes, you are.

59
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.310
Kip Twitchell: Okay, I'm on that.

60
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:23.760
andrea orth: Okay. Oh, are you, again, is it is yourself as host

61
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:29.670
Kip Twitchell: So I can do is, is to say, Well, I didn't get in this House.

62
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:31.950
andrea orth: Okay.

63
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.760
Kip Twitchell: I gotta figure out how to do that consistently.

64
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.250
I

65
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.970
andrea orth: Was going to share the screen but

66
00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:31.620
Sandy Peresie: Depressing side.

67
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:43.230
bobmcCormack: We are seeking divine intervention then Randall.

68
00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:48.240
bobmcCormack: You're looking heaven woods

69
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.180
Randall Ness: Oh, I've got, I've got two monitors.

70
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:58.170
Randall Ness: I've got my camera here on the on the laptop and since I'm multitasking, of course.

71
00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:58.770
Randall Ness: Yeah.

72
00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.870
Randall Ness: I'm always checking out. What else is going

73
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.290
On

74
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.310
Randall Ness: Michael Shapiro calls this Randall leising

75
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:09.180
Ah,

76
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:10.500
It's

77
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:12.540
Randall Ness: One thing at a time.

78
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:23.880
Open Mainframe Project Community: Okay, I'm back and Andrea, I can make you host. And I realized

79
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.510
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think I'll remember next time, how to do that I have to go to the last pass

80
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.240
Open Mainframe Project Community: And logging come there.

81
00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.390
Open Mainframe Project Community: You should be down

82
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:39.420
andrea orth: There we go.

83
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.260
andrea orth: And I did just get the light credentials today.

84
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.340
andrea orth: I'm for the hosting but

85
00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:52.710
andrea orth: Try it.

86
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.110
Open Mainframe Project Community: No. Excellent. I'm glad you got them.

87
00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:08.850
andrea orth: Yeah, but all I did was I you sent me that slack or you set a slack about the video being too big and about all I did was download that video and I'm going to run it through King Asia.

88
00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:10.380
Open Mainframe Project Community: Okay.

89
00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:11.790
andrea orth: Make it smaller.

90
00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:18.840
andrea orth: Thank you, but I also didn't want to do that for this meeting because you would hear the fans. Keep going on my compare

91
00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:19.470
Yep.

92
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:34.680
andrea orth: Okay, I'm going to skip these items right now. We'll just go through these issues. Oh, in related to me. Finally, remembering das john for the same reason that credentials.

93
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:41.490
andrea orth: For this me there was an issue tied to it and I closed it. It was like super, super old

94
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:52.080
andrea orth: Alright, I'll let the person who created them. Go ahead and discuss them.

95
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.680
andrea orth: Because I don't need to read them for everybody.

96
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.680
Sandy Peresie: The Mo, creating a repository for regression test bed.

97
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:03.960
Sandy Peresie: So that people can

98
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.030
Sandy Peresie: Have or

99
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.250
Sandy Peresie: Companies can have a

100
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:20.730
Sandy Peresie: Way to download some sets of data to do a regression test because one of the most expensive things for people to do was regression test Geneva updates.

101
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:22.200
Sandy Peresie: So,

102
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.600
Sandy Peresie: We just have to create the repository. I don't think we want to

103
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:40.110
Sandy Peresie: Create it or put it in a different repository. I think we agreed that we should create a separate repository for this but open to discussion.

104
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:46.830
Open Mainframe Project Community: That's what I remember as well.

105
00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:02.850
Sandy Peresie: Creates the report created the other repositories, I guess, is the question, can we assign that to this person as well.

106
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:11.160
Open Mainframe Project Community: So I let pardon me, Sandy. We have a resources repository.

107
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:19.830
Open Mainframe Project Community: Where I thought this might go now. Is that an accurate remembrance on my part.

108
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.830
Sandy Peresie: Of what's in the resources repository.

109
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:32.790
Open Mainframe Project Community: I thought that I had thought that that was intended to be an element there. I thought we would have things like ACL.

110
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.890
Open Mainframe Project Community: And the test beds and that sort of thing and the resources repository.

111
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.550
Sandy Peresie: Well, okay then we can update this to

112
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.200
Sandy Peresie: You know,

113
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:49.890
Sandy Peresie: We'll use the resources repository for the for the test bed and when goes

114
00:19:54.150 --> 00:20:02.580
Open Mainframe Project Community: Question is, what would the tooling be around it, but we couldn't do that as a separate we've got the pure right this is a repository. So that sounds right to me.

115
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:13.050
Ian: I suspect we should have a dedicated repository for regression tests, though, for the test framework and that kind of thing.

116
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:34.920
Open Mainframe Project Community: I mean, if I I think I'd be inclined in when we start making progress. We don't have anything in the, in the end, the resources repository right now. So if all we're doing is like documentation and such. I'd inclined to not have repository sprawl.

117
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:40.890
Open Mainframe Project Community: Federal I could be voted over on that, if that's appropriate thing to do.

118
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.690
Ian: Yeah, once we get to

119
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:47.190
Ian: Something real, then I suspect it should be in its own wizardry.

120
00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:49.980
Open Mainframe Project Community: I could believe that that would make sense to me.

121
00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:51.660
Sandy Peresie: Can you move it.

122
00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.620
Sandy Peresie: I mean, without having confusion.

123
00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.830
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah, you can get started. As we mean to go on.

124
00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:12.240
Open Mainframe Project Community: Now you could you can pull it down. And you can you can move on your, you know, you just do a poll and you move things on the directory and you get to a pull request to push it back. Oh, I don't think that's very hard to do.

125
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:19.590
Sandy Peresie: And make the others inactive because we don't want people to go in and try and pull it from there from resources.

126
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:31.110
Open Mainframe Project Community: It would be in the history, but if they look you don't typically go back and look in the history of in a repository. It shows you what the current state is and it wouldn't show up in the current state of the repository.

127
00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.960
Sandy Peresie: So there's something else. You have to do when resources, then

128
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:35.190
Yeah.

129
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.940
Open Mainframe Project Community: If you, if you delete it out of

130
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.650
Open Mainframe Project Community: Resources it

131
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.550
Open Mainframe Project Community: Effectively, the current state of it doesn't show it anymore.

132
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:46.650
Okay.

133
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.020
Open Mainframe Project Community: That sound. Okay.

134
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.510
Sounds reason

135
00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:04.860
Sandy Peresie: Okay, well I can go in and update this tomorrow then motor decision is

136
00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.890
Sandy Peresie: My should rather do it right now. Andrea, that's up to you.

137
00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:13.830
andrea orth: All what you do it tomorrow.

138
00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:14.730
Sandy Peresie: Okay.

139
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.590
andrea orth: Doing it through the issues.

140
00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:28.830
andrea orth: Oh yeah, this one. Um, did you do this one. Kip

141
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:31.680
andrea orth: Cuz I

142
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.740
andrea orth: Can't no permissions there.

143
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:52.410
Open Mainframe Project Community: Uh, I actually no, I didn't do anything about Andrew, what do I need to do to do that. I saved today and did that still have the same problem. I put a new set of recording transcriptions from our last meeting now just today.

144
00:22:53.700 --> 00:23:01.590
andrea orth: Yeah, I saw that out. Good luck because I created a pull request but you know how we get those automatic emails.

145
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:10.080
andrea orth: And it says, oh, the report recordings are available and there's like one link for the host and then one link for everybody else.

146
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.300
Open Mainframe Project Community: No, I didn't know there was a link for anybody else.

147
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:13.830
andrea orth: I didn't know you were doing else

148
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.070
andrea orth: But I also don't know

149
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.920
andrea orth: Now I sit and think about it.

150
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.960
andrea orth: Um, since that's the open mainframe projects.

151
00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:32.970
andrea orth: I wonder

152
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.590
andrea orth: If that could be changed and

153
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.060
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think that's a good question.

154
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:49.020
Open Mainframe Project Community: What I would, what I do on this Andrea is I'm probably just had a comment and ask assign it to john martek okay can we

155
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.370
Yeah.

156
00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:54.300
andrea orth: Yeah.

157
00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:15.150
Randall Ness: See Andrea, could you please hit Control plus sign a couple times to make the font bigger for us older folks.

158
00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:15.900
All right.

159
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.620
andrea orth: Better, better

160
00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.160
Randall Ness: Thank you.

161
00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:23.970
Okay.

162
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.620
andrea orth: So this one, Sandy opened

163
00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:41.160
Open Mainframe Project Community: Oh, that's interesting.

164
00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.060
Open Mainframe Project Community: Can I try that right now.

165
00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.780
Sandy Peresie: I don't know if we maybe should be assigning this to

166
00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.250
Sandy Peresie: Get help people.

167
00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:15.810
Sandy Peresie: I thought this is right. I don't know if it's a, I don't know if it's a, I'm a permissions, or it's just a bug in the search

168
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:18.240
Sandy Peresie: GitHub.

169
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:22.620
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah, I

170
00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:30.510
Sandy Peresie: Mean I guess you're since you're God and GitHub for Geneva urs you should try it and see if you get the same thing.

171
00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:32.370
Open Mainframe Project Community: No, I didn't. I didn't, the same thing.

172
00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:33.450
Yeah.

173
00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:43.980
Open Mainframe Project Community: I did, I did quite a few commits that go across. Yeah, it goes across more repositories.

174
00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:49.050
Open Mainframe Project Community: But there's only. It doesn't even show the community repository.

175
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:50.070
Yeah.

176
00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.850
Sandy Peresie: I think it's confusing for people that are brand new. That's the only reason I put it out here.

177
00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.100
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah, how do you, where's where's the

178
00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:17.820
Open Mainframe Project Community: Where's the GitHub repository. They open an issue on it but sounds like a, an infinite loop.

179
00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:20.370
Sorry.

180
00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.350
andrea orth: They probably wanted just we'd have to find it.

181
00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:36.270
Open Mainframe Project Community: Well, we could take that to john her tech as well.

182
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.120
Open Mainframe Project Community: You'd have a better sense of that.

183
00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:42.780
andrea orth: Yeah.

184
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.090
Sandy Peresie: So we just assign it to john Martin.

185
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:55.770
Open Mainframe Project Community: I might. I might be inclined to set up a discussion with him. I think it's fair to him if you just sign up for half an hour of his time and

186
00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.320
Open Mainframe Project Community: If we have them ready to go through

187
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.320
Open Mainframe Project Community: If it's only one or two, we could assign it to him. That's for sure.

188
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:11.760
Sandy Peresie: Sorry. What's that, what's

189
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.810
Sandy Peresie: Going to reach out to john is are we

190
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.630
Sandy Peresie: Collecting all these is

191
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:23.850
Open Mainframe Project Community: So what would you suggest we do Sandy.

192
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.900
Open Mainframe Project Community: We should assign it to him and then

193
00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.360
Open Mainframe Project Community: Reach out to him for discussion.

194
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.020
Sandy Peresie: Well, I probably would.

195
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:37.800
Open Mainframe Project Community: You know,

196
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:44.130
Open Mainframe Project Community: That sounds good.

197
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.350
Open Mainframe Project Community: That's easy enough to test

198
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.890
andrea orth: Here always asked him to search and see what he gets.

199
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:53.700
Yep.

200
00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:01.110
Sandy Peresie: Well, I'll update the update a comment to ask him to do that. Thank you.

201
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.640
andrea orth: And we need to go through the good first issues.

202
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.710
andrea orth: I asked because we're 820 and I wanted to

203
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.620
andrea orth: Get some of these old see if we can get some of these old ones discussed

204
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:24.270
andrea orth: Box.

205
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:35.880
Open Mainframe Project Community: I'd be I'd be inclined to follow your lead. Henry. I'm just to go. We did talk about that one last time. It's worthy of discussion, but maybe put it at the end, people get to these

206
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.540
Transfers

207
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.090
andrea orth: Um, I

208
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:46.830
andrea orth: Think this one's just yeah I don't think there's an action item on this one.

209
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.280
andrea orth: I just think it can be probably close

210
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:51.900
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yes.

211
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:57.330
Open Mainframe Project Community: That was after we have the meeting. And we got the minutes out there. I think that's fine.

212
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.340
andrea orth: All right, is all about the release and see I build requirements.

213
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:19.200
andrea orth: Mom did curator release file.

214
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.340
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah.

215
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:32.880
andrea orth: That's this one my actual tape for the discussion.

216
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:43.650
Open Mainframe Project Community: We had. I mean, we've got the infrastructure meeting going now, right, and had a very good discussion about last time.

217
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.300
Open Mainframe Project Community: So,

218
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:52.620
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think maybe we've got, that's the place where we'll work this issue. I don't know that this issue adds anything

219
00:29:53.820 --> 00:30:01.500
Open Mainframe Project Community: To that ongoing meeting to continue to work that Bob, would you do you think you'd be Dustin causes you okay with that.

220
00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.270
bobmcCormack: Yeah, fine. Yeah, we can track that in the infrastructure meeting.

221
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:14.010
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think we could close it.

222
00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:38.460
andrea orth: Okay.

223
00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:41.790
andrea orth: Close it as well.

224
00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.680
andrea orth: This one's not valid anymore. Correct.

225
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.530
andrea orth: Or do you still need that.

226
00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.000
Open Mainframe Project Community: pondering here for a minute.

227
00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:15.240
Open Mainframe Project Community: We're still

228
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:23.610
Open Mainframe Project Community: We're still working a little bit the BB to connect JD PC driver for existing customers. We've gotta

229
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:26.160
Open Mainframe Project Community: We're kind of going on on that.

230
00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:28.530
But I

231
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:32.460
Open Mainframe Project Community: Mean aren't, aren't we

232
00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:40.800
Open Mainframe Project Community: Our approach on the project. It's a little bit of a capacity issue is really about converting to

233
00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:48.270
Open Mainframe Project Community: PostgreSQL isn't that the answer that we've really come up with on this issue, to be sure, to be honest.

234
00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.610
Randall Ness: That that's the preferred solution.

235
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.330
Open Mainframe Project Community: So, having come to that decision. Is there a need for this.

236
00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.040
Open Mainframe Project Community: Issue.

237
00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.820
Open Mainframe Project Community: I don't know that there's another way around it. Other than that.

238
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:07.440
Open Mainframe Project Community: Course

239
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.700
Ian: The only other ways to not have a workbench and all

240
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:23.190
Ian: Files, well not have a database of files behind the workbench.

241
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.390
Randall Ness: That's more of a long term solution. It is

242
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:29.310
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah, that's as much work as

243
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.530
Open Mainframe Project Community: More maybe more work on

244
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.430
Open Mainframe Project Community: Postgres. Right.

245
00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:34.920
Yeah.

246
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.600
Open Mainframe Project Community: I guess Andrea. It's a kind of a question here, right, this is, this is an issue.

247
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.890
Open Mainframe Project Community: This is an issue that we're having to work seriously on the project.

248
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.910
Open Mainframe Project Community: We have. So I'm not sure.

249
00:32:52.590 --> 00:33:00.510
Open Mainframe Project Community: I'm not sure. Maybe it may be worthwhile keeping this out there so that it shows you know what we're working

250
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:02.820
Open Mainframe Project Community: On the project.

251
00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:10.650
Open Mainframe Project Community: Maybe we just need to make an update on it. Same we've decided you know Postgres is the way we're going to go, and that's what we're working towards

252
00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.000
andrea orth: That makes sense to me.

253
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.560
Open Mainframe Project Community: Let's do that.

254
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.950
Sandy Peresie: Does that change the roadmap.

255
00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:24.450
Sandy Peresie: At all.

256
00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:32.190
Open Mainframe Project Community: Well, we don't we don't necessarily have timings laid out for that still

257
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:45.150
Open Mainframe Project Community: No, so it doesn't change the roadmap for the architectural direction. We were going to end. And it's in line with where we've been going architecturally

258
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.310
Sandy Peresie: I'm sorry, maybe not the roadmap, but the timings of the roadmap, I guess.

259
00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:00.960
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah, actually, maybe we should just talk about that for a minute and Randall.

260
00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:04.230
Open Mainframe Project Community: What's our sense on

261
00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:12.120
Open Mainframe Project Community: As this, there were, there was a burst of energy. I know in you took a busman's holiday. We're kind of

262
00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:19.800
Open Mainframe Project Community: Working seriously on it. Other other maintenance tasks impeding our

263
00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.200
Open Mainframe Project Community: Engines.

264
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:30.750
Ian: I haven't done anything for for a little while. I got to the stage where I could create a view with a comb and

265
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.350
Ian: Appear to compile it.

266
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.880
Ian: But that was about as far as I got and I've been chasing all things since then.

267
00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:43.140
Yeah.

268
00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:45.000
Open Mainframe Project Community: We just

269
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.330
Open Mainframe Project Community: Sandy and Andrea, I think part of

270
00:34:50.310 --> 00:35:02.880
Open Mainframe Project Community: I don't need to be comprehensive because I don't have the comprehensive view. But if I were to represent my sense of, we've got a number of issues we're working around security pieces on the workbench as well.

271
00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.490
Open Mainframe Project Community: existing customer demands on

272
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:10.110
Open Mainframe Project Community: On

273
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.210
Open Mainframe Project Community: What's called

274
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:20.580
Open Mainframe Project Community: So we're not making as much progress on this.

275
00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:24.150
Open Mainframe Project Community: In the last few weeks, as we were

276
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:33.570
Open Mainframe Project Community: maybe a month ago, one and RT se meeting when in you kind of came back with that status at that point. I've been able to, if I remember correctly, and I was

277
00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:38.220
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yes, he discussion, maybe just three weeks ago, two weeks ago.

278
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.090
Ian: Sure, I've also been looking at a little things to do with

279
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:50.430
Ian: Use of how we can get the

280
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:58.440
Ian: Underlying code working for a job or version of them are 91

281
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.820
Yeah.

282
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:03.540
Ian: I'm split between a number of different things.

283
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:04.680
Yeah.

284
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:17.310
Open Mainframe Project Community: Because of the Java the Java Mr 91 that helps us in the number of friends on the security points around the eclipse versions, perhaps, if I remember correctly.

285
00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:23.010
Open Mainframe Project Community: And other simplifications of the compilers and the number so

286
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:28.530
Open Mainframe Project Community: We're running a number of different initiatives here to just starting things out, aren't we

287
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.220
Ian: Yeah, they're all kind of in parallel.

288
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:33.570
Ian: Yeah.

289
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.850
Ian: And I can't split less. All right, so

290
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.170
Open Mainframe Project Community: This is a recruiting issue.

291
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.910
Open Mainframe Project Community: Java.

292
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:59.430
Open Mainframe Project Community: Java developers, but coming up to speed. To add assistance to you would be difficult to do. I do. I suspect

293
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:02.430
Ian: Yeah.

294
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:04.080
Well, we

295
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.140
Ian: Have a couple and where we're

296
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:10.290
Ian: beating them into submission.

297
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:13.890
Yes.

298
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.750
Open Mainframe Project Community: So I guess Andrea Sandy.

299
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:20.970
Open Mainframe Project Community: It's

300
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:33.570
Open Mainframe Project Community: We're not as far along in the in the development. The, the version of the workbench for outside use as we'd like to be

301
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:41.850
Open Mainframe Project Community: outside our existing customers and the TV to connect JD bc drivers.

302
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:47.130
Open Mainframe Project Community: I mean, I guess.

303
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:56.010
Open Mainframe Project Community: So having said that, Randall, Jim. I mean, do we want to consider taking another candidate.

304
00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:08.880
Open Mainframe Project Community: Give you to connect drivers and see if there's a way of getting access to those we haven't had much luck on that Randalls been chasing that we're not getting any responses back

305
00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:19.740
Open Mainframe Project Community: Sense might be that it could be the it's unlikely to bear fruit. And that's why we're not getting any response back from people were opinion about the issue.

306
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:24.510
Open Mainframe Project Community: Or is there is a really not much choice we have

307
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:26.010
Randall Ness: I think

308
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:36.870
Randall Ness: When you and Jim, I spoke last week, I think we just decided that we were going to focus on dB to for the internal customers and Postgres for the external customers and

309
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.560
Randall Ness: That was that we can reverse that if you like.

310
00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:45.810
Open Mainframe Project Community: I don't know if that's the case.

311
00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:53.220
Sandy Peresie: If that's the case, you probably from a timing perspective, don't have to get the DB to connect working right away.

312
00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.300
Sandy Peresie: In order to get additional people on

313
00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.600
Sandy Peresie: Didn't even hear us. Right.

314
00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.870
Sandy Peresie: That's why I was asking about the timing.

315
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:23.940
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah, but the issue Sandy, is it still delays are getting additional people to use the workbench, because if we don't have a DB to connect approach the new code base for Postgres is getting pushed out by some of the issues that are working on the DB to connect side of things.

316
00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:33.570
Jim Hladyshewsky: Kept the other thought is there isn't one of the guys from profit on the

317
00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.510
Jim Hladyshewsky: Executive Committee for yeah

318
00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.600
Jim Hladyshewsky: Yeah, don't reach out directly to him.

319
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:43.290
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah, everything else.

320
00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:47.130
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah, we could take this, take this traveling to

321
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:50.670
Open Mainframe Project Community: The right mentality. Now, you're right, GM and he was on the

322
00:39:51.210 --> 00:40:02.910
Open Mainframe Project Community: I just posted today my video of the pack the tag discussion and he you know so I reviewed his words today, there were very strong positive words then

323
00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.530
Open Mainframe Project Community: And what do we lose by doing that.

324
00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.860
Open Mainframe Project Community: There any risks for that. Probably not.

325
00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.730
Jim Hladyshewsky: I don't think so at least we had an answer.

326
00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:21.270
Open Mainframe Project Community: And it's bold. It's a bold move

327
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:24.780
Open Mainframe Project Community: Okay.

328
00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:30.210
Jim Hladyshewsky: Cuz internal the internal clients are covered by their own contracts. So we're fine. It's just

329
00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.410
Jim Hladyshewsky: Now, from an open source perspective what we do.

330
00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:42.630
Open Mainframe Project Community: Okay, then that's a task for me. So we're going to update this with assigned to me.

331
00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:48.360
Open Mainframe Project Community: And I'm going to go get a meeting with the

332
00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.890
Open Mainframe Project Community: With some someone at rocket. I think it was the CTO

333
00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:58.050
949 6620 6199: Is that Greg.

334
00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.870
Open Mainframe Project Community: Now fortunately

335
00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:03.450
949 6620 6199: Ah, shame.

336
00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.520
Open Mainframe Project Community: Because Joe Devlin.

337
00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.210
Randall Ness: That's right.

338
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.600
Okay.

339
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:19.860
andrea orth: All right, I'm hearing, we

340
00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:37.650
Open Mainframe Project Community: We can move on, let me just say that issue right there is driving exactly the kind of discussion, we need to have thanks for everybody. Participating that in a transparent way right this is this is one of our key gatekeeper gate holders on us right now. So thanks for that.

341
00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.610
See

342
00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:54.840
andrea orth: the Getting Started guide.

343
00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:00.210
Open Mainframe Project Community: This is dependent on the BBC drivers.

344
00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:05.520
Sandy Peresie: No.

345
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:07.080
Sandy Peresie: No.

346
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:07.620
Oh,

347
00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:25.410
Sandy Peresie: You know when you don't know what you're doing and you're a total doofus guide and I have to, I have to reach out to ray to see if he's finished the review. He sent me a note and then then he dropped off the face of the earth. So let me let me get back to him tomorrow.

348
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:27.090
Sandy Peresie: Okay.

349
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:31.290
Open Mainframe Project Community: You're right. SANDY I misread it. It's not the Getting Started with Jenny VRS. It's the time

350
00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.030
Open Mainframe Project Community: She's joining the community guy.

351
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.870
Yeah.

352
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:39.930
andrea orth: I think our last one.

353
00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.850
andrea orth: Is probably something I haven't done yet.

354
00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:57.900
andrea orth: Okay.

355
00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.940
andrea orth: I think maybe this

356
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:02.700
andrea orth: Is clozaril

357
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:10.620
andrea orth: Because we did put something out there. The link to the TASC minutes

358
00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:17.310
andrea orth: Equal kind of past the, hey, we have a logo.

359
00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:22.530
Open Mainframe Project Community: And I think if you want to click on that link. I think

360
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:31.620
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think I did that. Oh, actually, I got an invite to sign up for the eye on the main framer podcast.

361
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.710
Open Mainframe Project Community: And I think

362
00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:39.360
Open Mainframe Project Community: I looked over this and I think we've got all the other things done there. So I think Andrea, you're right.

363
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.830
andrea orth: Okay.

364
00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.650
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think that was issue 17

365
00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.050
andrea orth: Yes.

366
00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:55.740
andrea orth: Now unless someone has objections I was going to go back up to

367
00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:02.580
andrea orth: What look like. Here we are agenda items.

368
00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:08.520
andrea orth: Yeah.

369
00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.750
andrea orth: Is there something remaining

370
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:22.230
andrea orth: That we need to change in zoom for these automatic updates.

371
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:29.910
Open Mainframe Project Community: So, so if you go to the calendar, the calendar is showing correct

372
00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:35.850
Open Mainframe Project Community: But right i did i don't know that i got a meeting notice from the calendar right

373
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:45.150
Open Mainframe Project Community: Did any i i saw last time the calendar automatically send out a meeting. Notice

374
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:46.230
andrea orth: Mm hmm.

375
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.870
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think maybe what we ought to do is

376
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:55.050
andrea orth: Maybe get help action issue.

377
00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:59.280
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yes, I think that we've got a problem there.

378
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:18.390
Open Mainframe Project Community: So actually, Sandy, could I recommend. Let's take this one on the calendar and the zoom sharing one and the Geneva ERS and assign those the search

379
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:24.900
Open Mainframe Project Community: Assigned assign those all three to me and all set up something with john martek to discuss

380
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.420
Open Mainframe Project Community: So instead of just having them throwing them over the wall to him.

381
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:38.520
Open Mainframe Project Community: So that's issue number 15 number 47

382
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:41.370
Open Mainframe Project Community: And this one will be assigned to me.

383
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:44.070
Sandy Peresie: Okay.

384
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:54.960
Open Mainframe Project Community: And Andrea, I'll try to schedule you and Sandy your tablet. Have you joined to do that meeting with john so that we get more people hearing what he's talking about.

385
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.650
Open Mainframe Project Community: A good approach, Andrew.

386
00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.160
andrea orth: Sounds like a good approach. Yeah, okay.

387
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:12.270
andrea orth: All right. And one more. Which I added. I think he has two items in it.

388
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.670
andrea orth: Yeah, I'm option or bullet number one.

389
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:26.460
andrea orth: Should we come up with rules for yourself on reviewing pull request because I know Bob had one out there that

390
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.790
andrea orth: I think we all kind of forgot about

391
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.750
Yeah.

392
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.040
Open Mainframe Project Community: Actually

393
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:39.480
andrea orth: Other parts, kind of related. Do we have enough people to assign for reviews.

394
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:47.370
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah, so one thought on the first one, Andrea is maybe we ought to think about making a standing item for

395
00:46:48.540 --> 00:47:01.620
Open Mainframe Project Community: The PSC meetings to just see, hey, not necessarily review, but to review if if there's things outstanding because that will be twice a month if if we're doing that process. Right.

396
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:03.150
andrea orth: Yeah.

397
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:15.780
Open Mainframe Project Community: So Sandy, there is on the second part of that.

398
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:17.760
Open Mainframe Project Community: Sandy.

399
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.260
Open Mainframe Project Community: Sandy wasn't an

400
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:35.070
Open Mainframe Project Community: Update on the community repository, and we had some things or she needed to be recently. So I think there is a need to expand a bit more with what's going on here.

401
00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:39.900
Open Mainframe Project Community: Some of our competitors on repositories.

402
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:47.490
Open Mainframe Project Community: If you go to the the community. If you go to the instead of the issues to the

403
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:53.430
Open Mainframe Project Community: TASC there's a CS the file in the TASC directory

404
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:55.050
Open Mainframe Project Community: Of the code.

405
00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:03.150
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah reprints and I think it's that repose right there repo CSP.

406
00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.640
Open Mainframe Project Community: This right now has

407
00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:15.150
Open Mainframe Project Community: Oh, poor me. Now, this doesn't. It's back it's

408
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:17.220
andrea orth: Kind of

409
00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.800
Sandy Peresie: It's committed or something or another.

410
00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:21.150
Open Mainframe Project Community: its competitors. Pardon me.

411
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:22.080
andrea orth: And we are

412
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:33.300
Open Mainframe Project Community: So happy to consider updates to this and that are needed. So you're going to add Sandy.

413
00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:36.210
Open Mainframe Project Community: And john merchants.

414
00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:45.600
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah, yeah. Sandy would make an update and a pull request against this document that he would use it, then to make those updates.

415
00:48:54.330 --> 00:49:01.800
Open Mainframe Project Community: I did try to make it initially. So there were, you know, always were two on each repo happy to have feedback if there's

416
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:04.170
Open Mainframe Project Community: If that's not adequate.

417
00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:12.540
Sandy Peresie: It's concerning is that, you know, when you're looking at the

418
00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:23.010
Sandy Peresie: The assignee and the labels, unless you're a competitor.

419
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:40.170
Open Mainframe Project Community: You're breaking up just a bit Sandy, I think.

420
00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:49.830
Sandy Peresie: I said, I said, it's hard to investments shoes and stuff have you don't have the ability to be a competitor. If you're not a competitor.

421
00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:55.740
Sandy Peresie: Did you hear that

422
00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.570
Sandy Peresie: Yes. Okay.

423
00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:05.070
Sandy Peresie: But you know, I understand the reason also not to have a bazillion competitors.

424
00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:24.660
Open Mainframe Project Community: So I think I might drop off.

425
00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.970
Open Mainframe Project Community: Since he's not participating

426
00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.900
Open Mainframe Project Community: We got to take him off of this list.

427
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:35.130
Open Mainframe Project Community: To reduce the list anyway. Right, sure.

428
00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:36.900
Open Mainframe Project Community: Um,

429
00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:55.170
Open Mainframe Project Community: I guess my sense right now is I'm happy to have comments back around. But I think we're appropriately learning how to do this process through through what we're we're figuring out

430
00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:57.390
Open Mainframe Project Community: And then

431
00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:03.810
Open Mainframe Project Community: Maybe there's a little bit more experience that's needed before we do something radically different.

432
00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:11.670
Sandy Peresie: Is that something we can talk to john about. I mean, you know, is there some

433
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:16.440
Open Mainframe Project Community: Their security setting that we could have changed on that we could control that better.

434
00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:17.580
Yes.

435
00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:20.040
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yes.

436
00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:27.900
Open Mainframe Project Community: So the point specifically there just to get down in the minutes it's around labels. Right.

437
00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:31.050
Sandy Peresie: Labels and assign ease. Yeah.

438
00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:35.190
Open Mainframe Project Community: That's excellent.

439
00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:55.620
Sandy Peresie: You know there's I'm happy to, to keep an eye on the issues you know all the issues and you know make sure they all have an assignee and make sure they get updated, but not if I don't have ability and but I don't necessarily want to be a computer and a reviewer on every week. Oh.

440
00:51:56.220 --> 00:52:07.650
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah, I like that. So we're going to get this one assigned to me as well. And we'll add it to the other three that we're going to discuss with john Merton, that's a good. That sounds like a good approach me on that.

441
00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:19.110
andrea orth: Alright, we're through all our

442
00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:21.510
andrea orth: Issues.

443
00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:25.440
Open Mainframe Project Community: Actually Andrea. I was gonna ask do we have

444
00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:30.360
Open Mainframe Project Community: Do we have any issues under the spark repository. We are looking at

445
00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:32.940
Sandy Peresie: We do, yes, there's there's issues under

446
00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.120
Sandy Peresie: Different repositories. Yeah.

447
00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:39.600
andrea orth: RPC. Yes.

448
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:53.460
andrea orth: To start with this one. The Z PDT

449
00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:04.020
Open Mainframe Project Community: I knew this was issue number one.

450
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:07.740
Open Mainframe Project Community: Thank you.

451
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:15.180
Open Mainframe Project Community: I

452
00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:25.230
Open Mainframe Project Community: So I got I'm getting some pretty good feedback on this one. We're working this and actually quite seriously.

453
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.450
Open Mainframe Project Community: With the Z team.

454
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:42.840
Open Mainframe Project Community: Talking about alternative ways of getting access. Let me, let me just speak to that for just a moment. The, the general problem we've had with access to CEOs or

455
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:45.480
Open Mainframe Project Community: Our new project.

456
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:49.740
Open Mainframe Project Community: We've had an outsized influence

457
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:57.630
Open Mainframe Project Community: On that problem john martek I spoke to him yesterday and having some discussions with the z.

458
00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:04.200
Open Mainframe Project Community: People in the z team that have come up through the project come about because of the project in various ways.

459
00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:18.630
Open Mainframe Project Community: And john said yesterday, Kip I've been trying to find traction. Sounds like you've got a good opening here to be discussing how do we get better general access to CEOs for experimentation and open source projects so

460
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:32.940
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think I don't think this is needed for me to continue to make progress. I'm progressing that very well. I think we could close this issue Sandy. I'm sure you've been kind of part of my updates on those. Would you agree with her.

461
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:43.200
Sandy Peresie: Um, yeah, but I think we probably need some type of closing comment in here so that people know why we closed it

462
00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:54.240
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yes, I think that that's reasonable. So I could I could add that I can do an update on that. Okay.

463
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:55.200
Okay.

464
00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:04.080
andrea orth: Scholar source.

465
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:13.050
Open Mainframe Project Community: without reading the update, you know, Neil was going to make all the updates on this.

466
00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:15.630
949 6620 6199: Yeah.

467
00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:17.370
949 6620 6199: I

468
00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:18.750
949 6620 6199: Do

469
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:28.470
Sandy Peresie: Actually, the question the question in my head is you know I'm there was a whole bunch of

470
00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.650
Sandy Peresie: Comments on the pull request.

471
00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:54.390
Sandy Peresie: Right, so, um, you know, from a team perspective do we want to ensure a certain level of documentation or do we want to put this stuff out there and maybe just open up a separate issue to update the documentation in the cold. I mean what, what are your feelings about that.

472
00:55:54.840 --> 00:56:02.400
Open Mainframe Project Community: Well, actually, Sandy. That's a different issue. This one was opened by Bob because there a specific module missing the Barden

473
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.840
Sandy Peresie: Oh, OK. Sorry.

474
00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:13.740
Open Mainframe Project Community: And I think I was waiting for Bob to get his poll requests committed before I make this update

475
00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:21.720
Sandy Peresie: Right back to the to the documentation.

476
00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:29.580
Open Mainframe Project Community: Of the call. Okay. But this one, this one specifically is just on hold until we're able to get the transfer from the staffer

477
00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:43.020
Open Mainframe Project Community: Spark repository transferred over and Bob said to me last night you, Bob. I don't need to speak for you, but that you were working to get get ignore issue that had been located on that right

478
00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:47.040
bobmcCormack: Correct, yes, some progress on that.

479
00:56:48.300 --> 00:57:00.780
bobmcCormack: I've done the merge on my local repository. So I've got both both repositories. The IBM Sephora and the Geneva Drs. For this repo time they merged.

480
00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:10.590
bobmcCormack: And unfortunately when I try and do a push to the remote that is to the actual GitHub location. I'm getting an issue. So I'm working on an issue. So hopefully

481
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:14.670
bobmcCormack: I get resolved the next day or so and then

482
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.000
bobmcCormack: It may well be that

483
00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:29.670
bobmcCormack: We have to do a push to a new branch and that branch would then become subject to a pull request to override the master in the GitHub location.

484
00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:33.660
Open Mainframe Project Community: Okay, and then I want you to do that. I can

485
00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:40.350
Open Mainframe Project Community: I can update the I'll update for this one. I'll do a new poll request one

486
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.900
Open Mainframe Project Community: So I think this one's just on hold for a little bit more but no issues really here.

487
00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:47.940
Open Mainframe Project Community: Okay.

488
00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.540
andrea orth: Make note on licenses.

489
00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:02.190
Open Mainframe Project Community: You know I

490
00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:10.590
Open Mainframe Project Community: You know what, I think we did instead of this is, I deleted from the IBM safir

491
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:20.400
Open Mainframe Project Community: Bob and I talked over and we deleted from the IBM safir repo, those that had licenses outside of the

492
00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:22.950
Open Mainframe Project Community: Of the

493
00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:30.390
Open Mainframe Project Community: Apache 2.0 so I think we can close this Bob is that sound right to you.

494
00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:33.780
bobmcCormack: Yes recollection. I think that's correct.

495
00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:36.900
Open Mainframe Project Community: I deleted that play framework.

496
00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:45.120
Open Mainframe Project Community: Which was not something we need to carry forward was the major item, but dealt with so we can close this issue.

497
00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:48.060
949 6620 6199: start scanning

498
00:58:54.480 --> 00:59:02.250
Open Mainframe Project Community: Mean, we've we've been approved on the spark code scan for over a month now and that's what bots working so that we can do the import

499
00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:10.740
Open Mainframe Project Community: They've already. That's what the highlight of this problem was when they scan that they found something that I had added into one of my PLC is a year and a half ago.

500
00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:25.980
Open Mainframe Project Community: I'll play frameworks which wasn't an Apache 2.0 license and instead of, instead of adding a note on the licenses in the readme document I decided to delete the source code and not important to the Geneva urs project.

501
00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:31.140
Sandy Peresie: Okay, so do you want me to put a comment in and close it tomorrow.

502
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:35.010
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yes. Yep, we've deleted the source code that was non non compliant.

503
00:59:35.610 --> 00:59:36.060
Okay.

504
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:49.230
andrea orth: Number nine.

505
00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:55.170
Open Mainframe Project Community: Actually this is one Bob and I just talked about a minute ago. And he's

506
01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:06.720
Open Mainframe Project Community: Oh, unless this is different. This might be the same thing on the non compliant we deleted, we decided

507
01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:11.430
Open Mainframe Project Community: We remove that to point out. So I think these might be overlapping

508
01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:23.250
andrea orth: Your concurrence with kip on that.

509
01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:26.790
bobmcCormack: I think so.

510
01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:28.140
Cool.

511
01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:31.530
Sandy Peresie: Tomorrow,

512
01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:38.220
andrea orth: Alright, last one in this repository. Number five.

513
01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:59.250
Open Mainframe Project Community: I might say that we've got going on here. Sandy is the work of you and Neil and I've been doing daily on

514
01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.850
Open Mainframe Project Community: On the Y calm environment.

515
01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:06.090
Open Mainframe Project Community: Really help us prove this out right

516
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:11.760
Sandy Peresie: Yeah, let me put a put a comment in there. I'd like I think we should leave it open until we

517
01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:16.110
Sandy Peresie: Figure out if that's going to help us right yep

518
01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:17.190
Sandy Peresie: We're gonna do it.

519
01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:20.940
Sandy Peresie: Yeah okay, I'll make a comment update this

520
01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:31.710
andrea orth: All right, that's our last issue in this repository. We have seven minutes.

521
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:35.760
Sandy Peresie: Can we go back to the to the documentation thing.

522
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:49.050
Sandy Peresie: Um, you know, when reviewing a pull request. How do we want to handle things that may not be documented.

523
01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:50.880
Sandy Peresie: To

524
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.480
Sandy Peresie: An appropriate level.

525
01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:04.200
Open Mainframe Project Community: Sandy. I think your approach of of commenting and putting the pull request on hold is exactly the right way to handle it.

526
01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:06.150
Sandy Peresie: Okay.

527
01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:21.630
Sandy Peresie: Alright, I just want to make sure that that you know that we're all in agreement, you know, because we could we could put it out there and then just have someone go back in and update it with proper documentation to

528
01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:22.170
Open Mainframe Project Community: What

529
01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:23.040
Open Mainframe Project Community: Okay, so let's

530
01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:33.060
Open Mainframe Project Community: Just go there just for a minute on the specific code that you found right it was something that Neil and I worked on during one of our Friday morning R amp D sessions.

531
01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:40.500
Open Mainframe Project Community: And I was slamming together some code really quickly that we were copying from other places. And I didn't really document it very much at all.

532
01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:49.650
Open Mainframe Project Community: So I might come back to you. If you put in, you know, comment out there. I might come back to you and say, Sandy, this isn't working code.

533
01:02:50.430 --> 01:03:00.390
Open Mainframe Project Community: I, I'd rather I next time I go through, I will add more documentation to it. Could we commit this though, just so we don't have, you know, a branching issue involved.

534
01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:13.440
Open Mainframe Project Community: And we just have that little discussion. I think that would be okay. But I think it's I think it's appropriate for whoever's a competitor to stop go that doesn't have doesn't meet the standard. I think that's appropriate to do

535
01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.190
Sandy Peresie: Okay, that sounds like a good compromise.

536
01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:21.720
Open Mainframe Project Community: Which is that is that

537
01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:27.420
Sandy Peresie: I don't think it's an issue. It's just a I didn't open an issue for it. Sorry.

538
01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:28.680
Open Mainframe Project Community: Oh, no, no, that's

539
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:35.130
Sandy Peresie: A general discussion point. Good. You know how tough, should we be when we're reviewing

540
01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:37.020
Good.

541
01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.640
andrea orth: Else anybody would like to discuss. We have five minutes.

542
01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:05.610
Open Mainframe Project Community: Just two quick updates from me, Andrea I in the Slack channel I posted a video I was interviewed

543
01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:18.300
Open Mainframe Project Community: As part of the open mainframe project, and I'd missed the release. I didn't get a notice of the release as a quite a professional production facilitated by oh AMP T. F.

544
01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:25.050
Open Mainframe Project Community: On a on a YouTube channel for technology. I've also

545
01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:32.700
Open Mainframe Project Community: Share why they might be good to update every year is Andrea with the link to that.

546
01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:34.830
andrea orth: That's probably a good idea.

547
01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.840
Open Mainframe Project Community: I also did post today on the YouTube channel.

548
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:50.730
Open Mainframe Project Community: The edited version of the tack meeting with slides that I given there because I thought it gave a fairly good overview

549
01:04:51.840 --> 01:05:00.990
Open Mainframe Project Community: To those people that were, we were introducing Geneva ERS to I'd encourage you, maybe to go listen to that video and here

550
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:13.650
Open Mainframe Project Community: These are serious technology people on the L amp D Technical Advisory Committee and how they reacted to the the relationship of junior year is to spark and how interesting that connection was

551
01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:24.120
Open Mainframe Project Community: I thought of listening and editing again today I thought it was telling as to how they quickly were able to draw those connections from the tech meeting.

552
01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:39.630
andrea orth: Alright, um, housekeeping question that just popped up popped in my mind.

553
01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:46.650
andrea orth: So now the two of us have access to download the recordings, um,

554
01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:54.720
andrea orth: How I want to say he's responsible for doing that and putting putting them and get lab.

555
01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:55.950
Yeah.

556
01:05:58.530 --> 01:06:07.410
Open Mainframe Project Community: So I guess, Andrew. Maybe we got to make it the person taking the minutes how to take responsibility for that, because then they both go in the same folder and makes

557
01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:08.940
Open Mainframe Project Community: The PRS cleaner.

558
01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:11.040
andrea orth: Yes, it does.

559
01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:13.770
Open Mainframe Project Community: I'll take that on.

560
01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:14.940
Okay.

561
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:17.760
andrea orth: That sounds fine.

562
01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:21.990
andrea orth: Anything else

563
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:33.000
Open Mainframe Project Community: Hey, I don't know if we had if we had an opening thought, did I miss the opening thought today I thought Bob was going to give her opening

564
01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:37.530
bobmcCormack: I know we didn't Randall was demonstrating his prayer position.

565
01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:43.470
Randall Ness: Be opening up today.

566
01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:47.610
Open Mainframe Project Community: That was a nice work that was really well.

567
01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:48.000
Done.

568
01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:50.610
Randall Ness: I think you're still

569
01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:52.560
Randall Ness: You're still on the hook for the opening thoughts.

570
01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:58.800
Open Mainframe Project Community: This is great.

571
01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:03.240
Open Mainframe Project Community: But maybe maybe we've had a closing thought there by Bob just about

572
01:07:06.930 --> 01:07:18.780
Open Mainframe Project Community: Him. I really enjoyed working with you. I really enjoy the progress and the energy. We've got and I really, we should make a shout out here guys to to Sandy.

573
01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:29.700
Open Mainframe Project Community: Who is giving us a lot of her time and is really driving a lot of the energy in a number of different areas. Not that the rest of you aren't working hard.

574
01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:36.360
Open Mainframe Project Community: I don't mean that. But hers is particularly of a volunteer nature given her employment status right now and

575
01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:50.910
Open Mainframe Project Community: Boy, she's she is very helpful to me, you should I want you all to know how helpful sandy is to me on a daily basis. We talk almost every day and she helps me move something forward so shout out to Sandy.

576
01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.330
Sandy Peresie: Be honest. I pestered you every day.

577
01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.700
Open Mainframe Project Community: That's exactly what's needed

578
01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.450
Jim Hladyshewsky: I think kips just looking for someone to talk to.

579
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:09.840
Open Mainframe Project Community: Jim's got a tired after a couple years and he appreciate you taking over.

580
01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:13.800
Sandy Peresie: Thank you.

581
01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:23.220
Open Mainframe Project Community: Andrea you've ended one minute early your meeting to run almost better than mine.

582
01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:27.900
andrea orth: Done was go through issues so

583
01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.940
andrea orth: That was productive for my don't know

584
01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:35.910
andrea orth: Yet we have now hit our time.

585
01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.750
andrea orth: So, goodbye.

586
01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.030
andrea orth: weeks from now.

587
01:08:42.690 --> 01:08:45.300
bobmcCormack: Couple weeks. Okay. Cheerio.

588
01:08:46.170 --> 01:08:48.570
949 6620 6199: Everyone. Thank you. Take care.
