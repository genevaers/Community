Sandy Peresie: Can you hear me.

3
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:54.240
Sandy Peresie: Hey,

4
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.660
Ian: A good, thanks.

5
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.510
Ian: Oh, apart from being full cold, but yeah.

6
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.300
Sandy Peresie: Oh, you got a cold.

7
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.890
Yeah.

8
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.760
Ian: Well, not down here.

9
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:14.520
Sandy Peresie: Failure.

10
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.190
Sandy Peresie: Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that.

11
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:24.450
Ian: Yeah.

12
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:27.780
Sandy Peresie: Those are the worst.

13
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.170
Sandy Peresie: Boy.

14
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:32.970
Sandy Peresie: Not good.

15
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.150
Sandy Peresie: Don't go anywhere.

16
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.820
Sandy Peresie: near where you are.

17
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.150
Ian: Pretty much non existent Millie.

18
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:47.340
Sandy Peresie: Yeah I Blanca a couple of what group.

19
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.660
Sandy Peresie: Book groups on Goodreads and

20
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.880
Sandy Peresie: That's one of the one of the places that seems to have a handle on it.

21
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:04.200
Ian: Yeah, it does. That's, that's pretty good. That's one of the advantages, being a remote location.

22
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.210
Sandy Peresie: Yeah, for sure.

23
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.970
Sandy Peresie: For sure. Our numbers are spiking because of the because of the election, I'm sure.

24
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:12.960
Yeah.

25
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.090
Sandy Peresie: You know,

26
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.740
Sandy Peresie: Like, come on.

27
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.770
Sandy Peresie: Open up and

28
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.440
Sandy Peresie: Deal was that you talking

29
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.380
Neil Beesley: Help. If I had a microphone. There you go.

30
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.860
Neil Beesley: Cold weather so

31
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.600
Neil Beesley: Yes.

32
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.150
Neil Beesley: It's an issue.

33
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.350
Ian: Yeah, that's not part down here. It's all right.

34
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.710
Sandy Peresie: That's great. I always want to go to Australia.

35
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.570
Ian: Good, so lovely spot.

36
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:55.680
Yeah.

37
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.770
Sandy Peresie: I just like the accent.

38
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.080
Ian: Think. Mine's more English than

39
00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.010
Ian: I come from the north of England.

40
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.410
Sandy Peresie: I think so, yeah.

41
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.230
Ian: I told a god is where I come from.

42
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.530
Ian: But I've been here for 35 years now.

43
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.780
Neil Beesley: Wow. Any haven't lost the accent.

44
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.700
Ian: Oh yeah, he can take the boy out of Newcastle.

45
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.070
Neil Beesley: I've been here for 21 years in the US.

46
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.780
Ian: Yeah. Well, he's still got some oxygen from somewhere.

47
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:34.800
Yeah.

48
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.570
Neil Beesley: Stone of crows.

49
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.450
Ian: So can I chill.

50
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.930
Ian: Yeah.

51
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.060
Ian: Most of these are

52
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.420
Ian: Immigrants anyway.

53
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.130
GillianHannington: inbred

54
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:11.550
GillianHannington: Small

55
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.170
Sandy Peresie: Like you said it was rural

56
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.730
Open Mainframe Project Community: Hi this is kept this joining

57
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:22.980
Ian: Me.

58
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.060
Open Mainframe Project Community: And I remember to join as the host

59
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.510
Ian: I saw a little thing flashed up on my screen as

60
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:34.770
Open Mainframe Project Community: Well,

61
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:36.900
Open Mainframe Project Community: So my day is

62
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:38.580
I've

63
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.100
Open Mainframe Project Community: Been successful at that.

64
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.140
Open Mainframe Project Community: And it's

65
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.210
Open Mainframe Project Community: On time here.

66
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.590
Open Mainframe Project Community: Are we waiting for anybody. Should we get started.

67
00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.690
Sandy Peresie: I thought I saw Randall coming in.

68
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.350
Ian: But he's on he's on mute. I think

69
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.790
Sandy Peresie: They're

70
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.120
Sandy Peresie: Okay, he's got his phone. He's got his phone call. Okay.

71
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.520
Sandy Peresie: Didn't have the phone before

72
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:13.560
Randall Ness: Yeah, no, I'm here now.

73
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:17.400
Open Mainframe Project Community: Hey, Bob.

74
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.660
Open Mainframe Project Community: You like to give

75
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.280
Open Mainframe Project Community: You can give us a good thought to start our meeting this time.

76
00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.580
bobmcCormack: No, no, no, done enough

77
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:27.750
bobmcCormack: I suggest

78
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.440
bobmcCormack: I know when I picked. So let's have Ian on the podium.

79
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:39.810
Open Mainframe Project Community: That was

80
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:54.090
Open Mainframe Project Community: The guy in Finding Nemo. The Seagull. I know. And I the turtle. I don't know. That was kind of what I just got from there. I've seen it yet. It's good. That was those that was enough to start a meeting for the

81
00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:02.430
Open Mainframe Project Community: Great. Hey, thanks everybody for joining appreciate your being here, Andrea, I think you're taking minutes tonight.

82
00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:11.430
Open Mainframe Project Community: I apologize on my tardiness of preparing an agenda, but we did talk through a little bit

83
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:22.470
Open Mainframe Project Community: agenda for today. So how about if I just outlined that briefly for you here. What I thought we talked about open to suggestions. If there's other things we had to talk about

84
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:25.530
Open Mainframe Project Community: One, I wanted to give you an update to

85
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:26.970
Open Mainframe Project Community: Go ahead.

86
00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.170
Andrea Orth: Issues 68 is

87
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.530
Randall Ness: Full of potential items for

88
00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:44.070
Open Mainframe Project Community: Let me good. So we'll put that as an item. I'm going to start first by talking a little bit about environment.

89
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:53.730
Open Mainframe Project Community: Randall, and I had some discussion today with folks from by calm infinity and

90
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.140
I can give you an update.

91
00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.480
Open Mainframe Project Community: On that and Randall.

92
00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.490
Open Mainframe Project Community: can join in.

93
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.640
Open Mainframe Project Community: on that as well. Okay.

94
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:03.510
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think if we

95
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:08.220
Open Mainframe Project Community: Start there. The other thing that I wanted a little bit of

96
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.230
Open Mainframe Project Community: Update for myself on

97
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.100
Open Mainframe Project Community: Because I've been out of touch for a little bit. It's just where we're at. On

98
00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:25.920
Open Mainframe Project Community: The data and I'm a machine and progress on those points and then maybe Andrea I'll jump to issue 68

99
00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.630
Open Mainframe Project Community: Well, I'm logging on here to go find that

100
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:36.960
Open Mainframe Project Community: Other. Any other comments on agenda items that we ought to be

101
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.450
Open Mainframe Project Community: Discussing

102
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:48.600
Open Mainframe Project Community: If not, then maybe we'll just start there. That's okay.

103
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:51.030
Open Mainframe Project Community: Um,

104
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.560
Open Mainframe Project Community: Thank you for Andrea agenda item.

105
00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.500
Open Mainframe Project Community: So on the

106
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.850
Randall Ness: Environment thing.

107
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.100
Open Mainframe Project Community: We've Randall, and I had a discussion today with the

108
00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.490
Open Mainframe Project Community: Owners of Viacom infinity.

109
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.710
Open Mainframe Project Community: Home and I'm forgetting times last name.

110
00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.770
Randall Ness: Comma Moto moto

111
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.110
Open Mainframe Project Community: You know, Tom.

112
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.410
Open Mainframe Project Community: Clearly is supporting

113
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:28.770
Open Mainframe Project Community: Open mainframe projects.

114
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.100
Open Mainframe Project Community: From his company hasn't like six or seven

115
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.430
Open Mainframe Project Community: Of the open mainframe projects on his

116
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.780
Open Mainframe Project Community: On the

117
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.300
Open Mainframe Project Community: Icon affinity system.

118
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.980
Open Mainframe Project Community: The sense was that

119
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.580
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think that we have kind of

120
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.220
Open Mainframe Project Community: Taken on a bigger

121
00:17:51.720 --> 00:18:03.870
Open Mainframe Project Community: We've had our ambition is larger and our community is growing faster than probably most of the other systems involved the other projects involved. So it's caused a little bit of a

122
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:13.980
Open Mainframe Project Community: NX they're wondering how long this goes and and what the what their needs are for supporting us

123
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:23.760
Open Mainframe Project Community: I explained a time that I'm involved in some of the ongoing discussions, I'm having internally and IBM are about

124
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:39.990
Open Mainframe Project Community: The need for these kinds of environments for open projects for places people can come and collaborate on systems and and why that's important that for the platform for the growth for the software for the developers.

125
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:46.590
Open Mainframe Project Community: And and some of that involve what's developed out of that a little bit.

126
00:18:47.610 --> 00:19:01.110
Open Mainframe Project Community: Is an understanding the one of the key resources that are lacking in any place that dedicate some time to these kinds of efforts is system programmer time

127
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:10.440
Open Mainframe Project Community: That you know the number of system programmers that understands EOS is is fewer than the number of developers, by far.

128
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:34.830
Open Mainframe Project Community: And they're critical to maintaining the CEOs shared environment, which makes the environment, low cost for and highly stable because that's why the that's how it's been built. So it's that aspect of shared environments for people that that seems to touch a nerve and a number of instances.

129
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.730
Open Mainframe Project Community: What I have suggested

130
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:46.050
Open Mainframe Project Community: What's, what's coming out of this is kind of a sense that what's needed is we need

131
00:19:47.820 --> 00:20:01.020
Open Mainframe Project Community: Perhaps we need to think about suggesting another open mainframe project separate from Geneva ERS that deals with the need for CEOs as a paths.

132
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:16.770
Open Mainframe Project Community: Platform as a service offering and have within that tooling that can alleviate the burdens put on system programmers for administrating environments, for example.

133
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:27.540
Open Mainframe Project Community: If, if somebody like Tom was willing to dedicate some of his machine. Time to up in mainframe projects, there should be a place that

134
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:36.090
Open Mainframe Project Community: People can come and sign up for an account and get a small environment platform as a service environment.

135
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:49.140
Open Mainframe Project Community: But it doesn't require heavy system programmer capabilities they can set parameters around how you know what sort of resources can be consumed, what sorts of things can be installed and used

136
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:58.860
Open Mainframe Project Community: In that environment limitations that don't pose security risk or issues to the performance of the platform stability on the platform.

137
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:15.690
Open Mainframe Project Community: If you have that sort of that sort of configuration that could be put on these machines, then it would open up more capabilities for for people that are willing to dedicate some resources environments to be able to do that.

138
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.060
Open Mainframe Project Community: So all of that is the

139
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.640
Open Mainframe Project Community: feedback we're getting from Tom today is all in

140
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:33.510
Open Mainframe Project Community: Line with the sensitivity that we're talking about there at the end of the discussion, it came down to you know him saying I can't

141
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:43.020
Open Mainframe Project Community: bear this burden myself with with, you know, the size of of what you guys are trying to drive and the length of time that appears you're trying to drive things

142
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.980
Open Mainframe Project Community: So I invited him to join in the discussion with me.

143
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:51.690
Open Mainframe Project Community: And others about how we go solve these problems.

144
00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:54.150
Open Mainframe Project Community: So after

145
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.830
Open Mainframe Project Community: It leaves us a little bit in a

146
00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:04.950
Open Mainframe Project Community: limbo face it. We didn't quite get clarity about you know exactly what they can provide. And how long they can provide it.

147
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:17.730
Open Mainframe Project Community: But there was a sense that you know we are definitely hitting on some problems that are critical to to what we're trying to do in the open mainframe project.

148
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:31.170
Open Mainframe Project Community: And it's good to have that experience. It's good to have that feedback. It's good to have you know honesty from people like Tom and others about where we need to go solve these problems and the ability to influence the conversations

149
00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:34.920
Open Mainframe Project Community: Randall, would you add anything to that is that

150
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:46.230
Randall Ness: Well, let's see, you know, in our, in our discussion. He started out by saying that he was hoping we could provide some documentation for the open source software.

151
00:22:47.250 --> 00:23:00.720
Randall Ness: Designation because I mean his first concern was that he had no idea what what our software was or if he was even licensed to have it on this machine. So I'm just kind of wondering maybe we should follow through that without any way.

152
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.570
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah, that's a good point. Randall there.

153
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.700
Open Mainframe Project Community: Was there was some

154
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:09.450
Open Mainframe Project Community: feeling about that and maybe we need to make that more clear.

155
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.540
Randall Ness: On Geneva year s.org right

156
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.990
Open Mainframe Project Community: After thinking, well, I mean,

157
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:29.460
Randall Ness: Certainly, that wouldn't hurt that wouldn't hurt, but just I guess just to to make him feel more comfortable with what we're doing. We should provide him with something that says, here we are an official open source project. And this is, you know, our background and

158
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.820
Randall Ness: Just let them know that it's okay.

159
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.520
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah.

160
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:37.230
Open Mainframe Project Community: And that's

161
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.380
Open Mainframe Project Community: That's okay, to follow up with Randall, I can do that as

162
00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.030
Open Mainframe Project Community: Part of my ongoing discussions with

163
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.280
Open Mainframe Project Community: Them, I was finally taking your point a little bit differently.

164
00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:50.430
Open Mainframe Project Community: That our blog didn't answer if he went to Geneva urs.org

165
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:57.030
Open Mainframe Project Community: He probably picked up people at sounded to me as if he picked up our Wikipedia entry.

166
00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.390
Randall Ness: And so

167
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:08.220
Open Mainframe Project Community: You know, I think there's probably an edit that we should be making some updates that we ought to be making their make that clear because that's a

168
00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:09.570
Open Mainframe Project Community: independent source.

169
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:14.490
Open Mainframe Project Community: independent source but also maybe making a little bit more clear.

170
00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.890
Open Mainframe Project Community: In some way on

171
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:18.420
Randall Ness: Geneva ers.org

172
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:24.120
Open Mainframe Project Community: So, you know, some of that that content that he was asking for it sounds like to me.

173
00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:25.680
Randall Ness: Yes.

174
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:31.020
Open Mainframe Project Community: What else did you take away from that random

175
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:37.800
Randall Ness: What. Um, let's see. So obviously he's interested in

176
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:47.040
Randall Ness: Seeing what kind of synergy. He can have with us such that eventually, it could turn into something that would help him.

177
00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.500
Randall Ness: Capitalize on having offering us the surface.

178
00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.560
Randall Ness: Eventually helped his business.

179
00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:06.540
Randall Ness: He mentioned long tail investments, and this is something that this so he's willing to make investments, but he wants to make sure that there's something eventually in it for his company which is understandable.

180
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:11.430
Open Mainframe Project Community: Let me, let me add to this, but in a later discussion I had with him later this afternoon.

181
00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:18.360
Open Mainframe Project Community: He said he was very early on they had pioneered a bunch of the open source on

182
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:19.200
The Linux.

183
00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:22.350
Open Mainframe Project Community: MongoDB and

184
00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.930
Open Mainframe Project Community: Java early on and those kinds of things.

185
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:35.070
Open Mainframe Project Community: And he said that he's taken those into general managers of IBM say hey, you need to be more focused on open source on

186
00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:39.090
Open Mainframe Project Community: The Linux and he said he's our responses from that.

187
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.230
Open Mainframe Project Community: So,

188
00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.910
Randall Ness: Having his added

189
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:51.270
Open Mainframe Project Community: That we're now moving to have a similar conversation about z OS is a useful voice to to express what we need in that space as well.

190
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.860
Randall Ness: Yeah.

191
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:54.690
Randall Ness: Yeah.

192
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.410
Randall Ness: I didn't have any other comments. Okay.

193
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.980
Open Mainframe Project Community: Excellent. Any questions team that it's a little bit of an update for you.

194
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:17.280
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think one question that isn't being asked. BUT SO WE DIDN'T GET A LOT OF CLARITY about

195
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.280
Open Mainframe Project Community: You know what they can offer to us what we can use

196
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:33.480
Open Mainframe Project Community: Our sense from Randall I post processing is there still things that we can be advancing we're learning things by what we've done on the platform. I thank them very much for what they've done to date because it's just helping us learn

197
00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:38.100
Open Mainframe Project Community: As we're going through the process. And that's very helpful to us.

198
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:48.660
Open Mainframe Project Community: So I think there's still things that we continue to use the environment for such as we have and will continue to clarify with them. What

199
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.870
Open Mainframe Project Community: What they feel comfortable with and and

200
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.010
Open Mainframe Project Community: Where

201
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.260
Open Mainframe Project Community: They feel like they're we're asking for more than

202
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.070
Randall Ness: They're able to offer.

203
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:09.270
Randall Ness: Okay, yeah, yeah. Near the end of the call kip have any came in and then it sounded like he was still planning on setting up the Linux machine or any thing saying that they wouldn't they weren't going to do that.

204
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:10.260
Randall Ness: Now he did

205
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.460
Open Mainframe Project Community: I thought that same thing

206
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.760
Random

207
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.170
Randall Ness: Yeah.

208
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:17.040
Open Mainframe Project Community: Okay.

209
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:19.740
Excellent.

210
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:39.240
Open Mainframe Project Community: Okay, thanks for that. Um, can I give an update. Then for my own information on Sandy and I know I've gotten a little bit from Randall that Sandy from you on Randall, give me a little update on the data side of things that you've been working on.

211
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:46.320
Sandy Peresie: I can tell you a little bit about some of the stuff you know Randall, and I worked for a little bit today.

212
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.720
Sandy Peresie: On getting one of the reference data files up to the mainframe.

213
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.660
Sandy Peresie: And what we found out is that

214
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.260
You

215
00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:20.040
Sandy Peresie: When you load those up their Mac files. I don't have a Mac. I have a Windows. And so I'm I've been trying to figure out a way to change the Mac I'm files to Windows files, um, you know, and, and in process. I'm trying to mount

216
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:26.730
Sandy Peresie: A tribe on my, on my own bow to, you know, and it's not going fast.

217
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.140
Sandy Peresie: Let me put it that way but

218
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.260
Sandy Peresie: I'm certainly learning a lot like

219
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:38.700
Sandy Peresie: Um, you know, I thought there's a there's a Doss to Unix and then a Unix to Mac.

220
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.290
Sandy Peresie: Or Linux and Unix and a Unix

221
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.100
Sandy Peresie: To docile

222
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.410
Sandy Peresie: Um, I was looking to use that

223
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:53.820
Sandy Peresie: But it's becoming a little bit more difficult like thought it would be. Um, but I'll still keep I mean I'll keep plugging away at it.

224
00:28:54.180 --> 00:29:04.290
Sandy Peresie: So, Bob, I know that I'm gonna let you talk about the stuff that you've been doing with Randall, because I have a feeling you're gonna run into the same problem, and maybe you've already cracked us

225
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:05.820
Sandy Peresie: Not um

226
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:06.510
So,

227
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:10.830
Sandy Peresie: Um, do you wanna weigh in here at all.

228
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:12.510
bobmcCormack: Um,

229
00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:17.190
bobmcCormack: I haven't had any issues moving

230
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.680
Randall Ness: On to the GitHub site.

231
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.080
bobmcCormack: From windows.

232
00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.620
bobmcCormack: So that's not a problem. I haven't got a Mac and moving stuff from

233
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:29.940
Randall Ness: GitHub.

234
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.650
Across to sauce.

235
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:33.690
bobmcCormack: We've got

236
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.920
bobmcCormack: A conversion process in place and that seemed to work.

237
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.490
OK.

238
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:48.090
bobmcCormack: So, both for data and for members of a repository. So, no, I'm

239
00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:51.390
bobmcCormack: I'm not in the same ballpark as you

240
00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.300
Randall Ness: Well, I think that the

241
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.770
Sandy Peresie: Virginia data that you

242
00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:57.360
Randall Ness: Downloaded yeah

243
00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.900
Sandy Peresie: For fun data world.

244
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.180
Sandy Peresie: Yes, in Mac format.

245
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.090
bobmcCormack: I put it down onto my windows and

246
00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.840
bobmcCormack: Send one of the zip files up to

247
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:29.490
bobmcCormack: Viacom, and that went into USS I did an unzip there. And then I copied the files across into sauce using a sauce utility with a conversion parameter. And that seemed look

248
00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:29.940
Randall Ness: Okay.

249
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.260
bobmcCormack: Look like normal.

250
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.300
bobmcCormack: Spreadsheet data with

251
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.490
bobmcCormack: Comma Separated

252
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:36.960
Sandy Peresie: Huh.

253
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.030
Ian: The only difference for the mark is a new line at the end.

254
00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:42.570
Right.

255
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.070
Sandy Peresie: Yeah.

256
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:57.390
Randall Ness: I think Windows has character turn line feed Unix has only line feed back has only carriage return

257
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.480
Sandy Peresie: Right, right. So I was trying to get it.

258
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:06.630
Sandy Peresie: To be a carriage return line seed.

259
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.940
Sandy Peresie: On the file because when we load it, it's going in all this one record.

260
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:25.170
Sandy Peresie: Yeah, you know, all the reference data is going in this one record. So, um, you know, it's trying to get it over to the right. Um, you know, carriage return line feed,

261
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:33.120
Sandy Peresie: Prospect on my computer. So I could upload it through FTP so

262
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:47.970
Open Mainframe Project Community: One, you know, one aspect of this that Steve brown helped me with a couple of years ago was. And I don't remember where it fit in here but you can set in the UNIX system services side of things you can set an ISO

263
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:54.180
Open Mainframe Project Community: Encoding parameter on the file structure.

264
00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:56.310
Randall Ness: And

265
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.170
Open Mainframe Project Community: I don't know if I remember correctly, exactly how to do that. I do have a

266
00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:02.670
Open Mainframe Project Community: A

267
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:22.710
Open Mainframe Project Community: A link to a WebEx video where Steve was explaining this to she watches and ME, SANDY I might be able to share that with you and Randall, but maybe just with you. To begin with, that might be helpful in some portion of this space because I think that does help.

268
00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.410
Open Mainframe Project Community: Can help in some piece of this

269
00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.710
Sandy Peresie: That's possible. But again, I gotta

270
00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:35.190
Sandy Peresie: I gotta get a shared partition and mounted drive and all this stuff. I gotta work through that issue so

271
00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:37.110
Open Mainframe Project Community: It'll be a little bit tiring it I don't

272
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:53.940
Open Mainframe Project Community: I don't think that you had to, I think that when you got the files up to do is if you're in the UNIX system services side of CEOs, you can specify the file type and it knows how to handle these kinds of issues.

273
00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:54.900
Never give up.

274
00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:57.030
Randall Ness: If I'm thinking about it.

275
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.770
Sandy Peresie: Okay, um,

276
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.810
Open Mainframe Project Community: Let me um let me give you the link to that video.

277
00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:12.960
Open Mainframe Project Community: And we'll see if that if it gives such well we can cut down on this that might help us.

278
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:14.250
Okay.

279
00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.110
Open Mainframe Project Community: Okay, yeah.

280
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:21.990
Excellent.

281
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:32.490
Open Mainframe Project Community: So how about if I drop right into Andrea suggestion on the issue 18 has the

282
00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.070
Open Mainframe Project Community: Basic outstanding agenda.

283
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.350
Open Mainframe Project Community: Andrea, you had pull requests.

284
00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:43.650
Open Mainframe Project Community: We still have an issue with

285
00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.300
Open Mainframe Project Community: Committed and approve.

286
00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:46.650
On merge. Is that right,

287
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.020
Andrea Orth: Bob took care of that today.

288
00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.100
Open Mainframe Project Community: Oh, excellent.

289
00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:52.890
Very good.

290
00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.550
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think we're up next with in and a workbench update

291
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.100
Ian: Yeah. Just gonna find the mute button.

292
00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:14.280
Ian: workbench is going quite well.

293
00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.170
Ian: I have a

294
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.600
Ian: Postgres workbench that

295
00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.050
Will

296
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:20.910
Randall Ness: Accept

297
00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.960
Ian: workbench XML and import it. And I can

298
00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.480
Ian: Create views.

299
00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:33.270
Ian: activate them most things seem to be

300
00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:35.790
Ian: Ticking along

301
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:39.000
Ian: I'm also creating

302
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:40.950
Ian: Some

303
00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.850
Ian: Postgres SQL scripts, so that I can

304
00:34:47.040 --> 00:35:06.240
Ian: populate the database on the Sonics machine. Once we get there with the necessary tables and data and store procedures so that we can connect this new workbench into it and I know play away in our new playpen

305
00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:17.550
Ian: And find out what's wrong with it. I think there will be lots of issues occur when we first connected

306
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:24.090
Ian: But I'm trying to minimize them, but there is only little me doing it. I'm

307
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:24.630
Ian: Trying to

308
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.070
Ian: Involve but

309
00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.400
Ian: He will get there so

310
00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:32.790
Ian: So that's where I am. Okay.

311
00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:40.890
Open Mainframe Project Community: What's your sense in that's very good progress. What's your sense if your outline your, your biggest suspicion about the problem spaces.

312
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:47.010
Open Mainframe Project Community: What would be the, the biggest parts because those trips

313
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:58.230
Ian: Um, the, the stored procedures if I have not tested all of the scenarios, creating views and saving them and importing them.

314
00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.310
Ian: Have not really done anything to do with format views yet.

315
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:09.720
Ian: But the basic situations of creating views.

316
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.680
Ian: That activating them seem to rework seem to work. Okay.

317
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:14.550
Yeah.

318
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:35.880
Ian: Exporting from this database into workbench XML and so that we can put it onto the mainframe. I think there's a case sensitivity issue and that the the XML that gets generated has all the Tag Names and lowercase. I don't know if that'll be acceptable.

319
00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.650
Ian: Okay, but that's just a

320
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.250
Ian: minor issue to fix up

321
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:53.400
Open Mainframe Project Community: So if I were to restate that that's helpful. The, the core issue of being able to, you know, log in and create things new in the database and activate that is something that

322
00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:08.880
Open Mainframe Project Community: Is more solid when you go outside of that that quarter of core functionality to start doing other kinds of things that hang off of that that start to require they require the stored procedures that becomes

323
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:10.440
Very yeah

324
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:17.400
Ian: Yeah, we need some users to actually give this thing.

325
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.650
Ian: A bashing

326
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:32.370
Ian: And not done where it fails, so that I can fix them at the moment, I'm just blundering along fixing things as I find them and things that I think I need to do, whereas

327
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:40.710
Ian: The real user doing things or real tested trying to find out what's working, what's not working.

328
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:42.990
Ian: Is what's required

329
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:49.290
Open Mainframe Project Community: But can I ask this, maybe this is a dangerous question that everybody knows the answer to, but

330
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:56.490
Open Mainframe Project Community: If somebody wanted to set up on their own machine Postgres and and

331
00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:03.000
Open Mainframe Project Community: And do something on their own machine. Is that possible to do at this point over

332
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:04.020
Ian: It is, yes.

333
00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.580
Ian: It certainly is. I

334
00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:14.430
Ian: Have the code is not a you can't get it from GitHub, but I can give you a

335
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:18.750
Ian: deployable Java executable.

336
00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:29.370
Ian: And I can help you lead you through the the business of creating once you've got Postgres installed, how to get the database up and running.

337
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:39.240
Ian: In fact, I'm creating it so that the command line, you can just basically run a command line, and it will do it for you.

338
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.480
Ian: And then you can log in.

339
00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.320
Ian: So that's what I'm

340
00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:47.850
Ian: Trying to get at the moment.

341
00:38:48.210 --> 00:39:00.990
Open Mainframe Project Community: So we could. So just linking back around work I did two months ago on working on unlimited an evaluation license from, you know, the IBM

342
00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:07.230
Open Mainframe Project Community: The IBM dash safir GitHub sites.

343
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:29.730
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think we do have permission. So there's two ways that we could go after. If people needed to get the binary, I think, one would be that we can share just a very temporary box you can invite people into box. The IBM box environment and that the links expire after limited period of time.

344
00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:49.590
Open Mainframe Project Community: To give them a downloadable executable. Or we could go further. If we wanted to and put them out as the safir IBM safir evaluation copy executable would be another way to get the executable to people if we wanted to.

345
00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:56.880
Ian: Know, one thing I need to do is to remove the DB two databases bc paths.

346
00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:02.910
Ian: Because of licensing were unsure if we can really release that

347
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.100
Ian: Which seems a bit odd, because I'd be to the TV to

348
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:17.280
Ian: Clients studio contains JT BC and that's free to where

349
00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:34.920
Open Mainframe Project Community: You know, and actually in as you bring that up, Randall, there was a we not want to follow back up with many about this because he did ask a question on just another route for the JD bc driver today.

350
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:43.650
Randall Ness: Yeah, I'm not technical enough in that area to understand what he was saying, but had something to do with the type three driver. Does that ring a bell in

351
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:49.530
Ian: Um, I think the the levels of conformance to Jenny BC.

352
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.470
Ian: But it

353
00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:53.370
Ian: Should be

354
00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.030
Ian: Fairly straightforward to remove the DB to thing.

355
00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:58.860
Ian: Okay.

356
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:05.970
Ian: But our initial given that we've got a license. We can we can share things we can

357
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.950
Ian: make this thing work with a Postgres.

358
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:22.380
Ian: And the BBC thing just take I'll just take out the jar file and have the DVD JT BC and

359
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:28.380
Ian: And as long as you don't try and connect a DVD. You'll be fine. Well,

360
00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:39.210
Open Mainframe Project Community: So that's good. And so I guess I'd say if if if there's some way that the rest of us could be helpful in that process and

361
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.590
Randall Ness: Let us know.

362
00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:41.250
Right.

363
00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:49.350
Ian: If anybody wants to volunteer as being a guinea pig and have it on the machine, let me know and I'll work with you to get it on there.

364
00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:53.970
Ian: And that will be useful for

365
00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:55.740
Ian: Me.

366
00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:58.320
Ian: And I suspect we should start

367
00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:00.690
Ian: We all we could

368
00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:08.580
Ian: Start to create GitHub issues on the workbench, even though the workbench is not actually in GitHub yet.

369
00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:09.480
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yes. Yep.

370
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:21.960
Ian: And so we can raise the issue there and put them through the process and I can fix them and release new versions of the workbench and the code will catch up.

371
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:43.020
Open Mainframe Project Community: Well, that's great. And we could also I might also add we should I would suggest that if, if we take some notes as we're working with you to install it the first time that becomes the basis for a repeatable process that also we could have on GitHub. So becomes the you know the installation.

372
00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:44.910
Ian: Pieces.

373
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:52.110
Ian: So, so yeah, looking for volunteers, stick your hand up if you want to

374
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.060
Randall Ness: Get a copy in

375
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:58.020
Ian: Postgres on the machine. It should run on Unix as well.

376
00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:04.230
Open Mainframe Project Community: You know, so there's a sandy there's a good first issue.

377
00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:07.890
Open Mainframe Project Community: Maybe, maybe, maybe kind of deep, but

378
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:08.610
Open Mainframe Project Community: You could trust them.

379
00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:17.700
Open Mainframe Project Community: Fairly deep that if they if they wanted to. They don't have to learn code there an end user to install and many things.

380
00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:22.470
Sandy Peresie: Yeah. Very true, very true. We can put it out there as a good first issue.

381
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:29.130
Sandy Peresie: Um, I haven't gotten to the while we give you the update on that other thing.

382
00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:31.950
Sandy Peresie: When you're when you actually get there.

383
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:37.710
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think maybe we're ready when you go ahead with that now Sandy. I think that's good. Anything else you may

384
00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:38.370
Andrea Orth: Hang on.

385
00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:40.590
Open Mainframe Project Community: Sorry.

386
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:45.840
Andrea Orth: Go ahead and drop which repository, would we be opening the issues in

387
00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:47.730
Andrea Orth: This question.

388
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:52.770
Ian: We were going to create a workbench repository. So I will put them in there.

389
00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:55.500
Andrea Orth: Okay.

390
00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:01.980
Andrea Orth: And I'll want to install it locally on my machine. Whenever we can work out fine.

391
00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:05.580
Ian: Cool.

392
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:12.390
Ian: So, I mean, they will organize a time free just about whenever really

393
00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:20.010
Open Mainframe Project Community: And then I was going to look here under our

394
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.830
Open Mainframe Project Community: Under repositories under

395
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:43.620
Open Mainframe Project Community: Me and other repositories. We were going to make. Yes, we're going to make the workbench repository. So I need Andrew either you or I'd have to probably reach out to john martek

396
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:45.240
Open Mainframe Project Community: And say john are ready.

397
00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:46.920
Randall Ness: To make the intro positive

398
00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:53.220
Andrea Orth: Oh, is there anything other than just sending him an issue going

399
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:55.140
Open Mainframe Project Community: Probably not. We have

400
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:56.310
Open Mainframe Project Community: So under the

401
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:58.740
Open Mainframe Project Community: Under the community TASC

402
00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:02.520
Open Mainframe Project Community: We have the repos. Yes, we have. And then

403
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:03.780
Competitors

404
00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:08.250
Open Mainframe Project Community: We have the check marks as to who

405
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:08.970
Andrea Orth: Right.

406
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:13.410
Open Mainframe Project Community: We're supposed to have access. So I think book with both of those is what he needs.

407
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:27.810
bobmcCormack: Good. Keep on that, don't we really need to create a repo in IBM SAFA and position the

408
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:28.860
workbench.

409
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:33.840
bobmcCormack: Software their first for scanning or we just haven't yet downloadable

410
00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:34.710
Open Mainframe Project Community: So,

411
00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:41.550
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think, I think we're, we're starting Bob. Good question. I think we're starting with the repo in Geneva ers. But that's only for issues.

412
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:51.720
Open Mainframe Project Community: It. Well, I can't get any source code right now. But when we go to the source code, you're exactly right. We will have to go that route of the IBM safir route to have it scam first

413
00:45:54.540 --> 00:46:00.300
Open Mainframe Project Community: But I think we're just opening up the end of the year is workbench repository to track issues.

414
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.100
Randall Ness: And the install instructions.

415
00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:03.660
Randall Ness: To begin with,

416
00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.040
Open Mainframe Project Community: It all will be doing there.

417
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:10.710
Ian: Yeah. And, and I would like to be able to get the code out there.

418
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.850
Ian: In the not too distant future. Yeah, no.

419
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.440
Open Mainframe Project Community: That'd be great. Wonderful.

420
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:19.980
Randall Ness: Great progress.

421
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:23.430
Open Mainframe Project Community: If there was nothing else on this. I want to go back to Sandy, for a moment, you

422
00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.260
Open Mainframe Project Community: You are going to make a comment. Sandy.

423
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.130
Randall Ness: Kind of

424
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.280
Sandy Peresie: Just that I am, I spent a couple hours.

425
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:52.590
Sandy Peresie: You know couple, couple of mornings I guess with Ray and we went over the documents and he was going to clean that up and get that out to me so it's ready to be reviewed and forth into the into the repository. Where do you, you would probably want to connect it also to the

426
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.340
Sandy Peresie: To the Geneva urs how we work.

427
00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:58.170
Sandy Peresie: Um,

428
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.110
Randall Ness: Website.

429
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:05.070
Sandy Peresie: Yeah, so, um, as soon as

430
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:11.190
Sandy Peresie: As soon as he sends it to me. Um, I'll have to put it out there somewhere.

431
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:12.030
So, so

432
00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:21.210
Open Mainframe Project Community: Good. Just to clarify, mature world so everyone's on the same page. This is basically a getting started document for becoming a member of the community. Right.

433
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.590
Sandy Peresie: Let's say onboarding yeah

434
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.580
Sandy Peresie: Yeah, so

435
00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.000
Open Mainframe Project Community: Unity. So it seems to me, it should go under the Community.

436
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:27.840
Randall Ness: Repo

437
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:29.730
Randall Ness: Would be a place for that to

438
00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:30.150
Go.

439
00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:35.160
Open Mainframe Project Community: And since you have it as a standalone document. Why make it

440
00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:38.340
Open Mainframe Project Community: Standalone getting started.

441
00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:38.610
Randall Ness: Or

442
00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.860
Randall Ness: You know onboarding whatever

443
00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:45.750
Open Mainframe Project Community: Whatever the name is what we'd want to link to it. I would think from the readme document.

444
00:47:47.010 --> 00:48:01.470
Open Mainframe Project Community: Okay right up front, people can say, hey, here's how to contribute, there's a there's a section in the readme right now that is contributing actually maybe in fact we are to folks that contributed document.

445
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:19.710
Open Mainframe Project Community: Is it's about contributing code. But that's fairly wide and that's long ways down the road. So maybe we're replacing the contributing document with what you've got, adding that contributing code point to the very bottom of the document in some way.

446
00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:22.440
Sandy Peresie: Okay.

447
00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:23.940
Sandy Peresie: Um,

448
00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:31.170
Sandy Peresie: Okay. And then once it gets out there, then maybe Andrea can can put a link on the website.

449
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:32.940
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yes, that'd be great.

450
00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:40.590
Sandy Peresie: Okay. And then, I will send that also to Fatima, who is our, our South Africa.

451
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:50.280
Sandy Peresie: Recruit um and asked her to go through and because she hasn't signed up yet either. Um, but around that.

452
00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.200
Sandy Peresie: I still think we have a

453
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.790
Sandy Peresie: Step that has to be done for

454
00:48:53.790 --> 00:49:00.240
Sandy Peresie: Both Neil and I'm Ray because they are not on the project.

455
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:04.470
Sandy Peresie: Don't know what that step is, and I've got to add it to the document.

456
00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:05.850
Neil Beesley: So, yeah.

457
00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:08.190
Neil Beesley: Yeah for definite yeah we've

458
00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:08.880
Randall Ness: We've been

459
00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.730
Neil Beesley: Had a few go rounds on that.

460
00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:14.760
Open Mainframe Project Community: I was supposed to

461
00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:20.760
Open Mainframe Project Community: Play.

462
00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:22.890
Open Mainframe Project Community: With me

463
00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:31.260
Sandy Peresie: Okay so so well. What I've done is I put in the document that you know open an issue to ask to be added to the project.

464
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:44.190
Sandy Peresie: Okay. And then on if we if that's fine. And people can just open the issue. And when you get to it. You get to it that, that's fine. But, you know, we might want to think about more than one person being able to do that.

465
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.070
Open Mainframe Project Community: As well. So I see Paul

466
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:52.500
Open Mainframe Project Community: I see Neil is part of the

467
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:55.530
Open Mainframe Project Community: Rest email group.

468
00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:56.850
Sandy Peresie: Right.

469
00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:58.530
With

470
00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:04.440
Open Mainframe Project Community: Neil, are you, your email is listed as Neil

471
00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:05.820
Open Mainframe Project Community: At

472
00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:06.390
IBM

473
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.610
Open Mainframe Project Community: Maybe it should

474
00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:11.010
Open Mainframe Project Community: Is that ibm.com

475
00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:12.480
Neil Beesley: Oh, no, no.

476
00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.160
Neil Beesley: It's

477
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:16.860
Neil Beesley: ibm.com but I

478
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:17.670
Open Mainframe Project Community: Am back on.

479
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:18.900
Open Mainframe Project Community: Okay, just

480
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:20.070
Randall Ness: I don't have access

481
00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:23.160
Neil Beesley: To email at the moment because he's a contractor kip

482
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.670
Randall Ness: Contractors don't have the US. Great. Thank you.

483
00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:27.960
Randall Ness: But I did.

484
00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.420
Neil Beesley: I did lose email access

485
00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:34.380
Neil Beesley: late this afternoon, and I'm still trying to get that back. Okay.

486
00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:45.660
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah, so what does it. How do we know that is not part of the. Is it is it in GitHub, that you don't have access to the repos. Is that what it means.

487
00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:48.270
Sandy Peresie: If you look under projects.

488
00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:53.250
Sandy Peresie: You look under people in the project Geneva us he's not there.

489
00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.440
Sandy Peresie: He gets there.

490
00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:09.390
Open Mainframe Project Community: Okay, so I think what that is.

491
00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:23.580
Open Mainframe Project Community: Sandy is probably another discussion with john martek go back and answer that question. And I find it. I find it fairly effective if I, if we do just set up a conversation with john

492
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.260
Open Mainframe Project Community: To ask him these kinds of

493
00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:31.140
Open Mainframe Project Community: Questions is more effective than

494
00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:33.630
Open Mainframe Project Community: Trying to have him write something

495
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:34.170
Open Mainframe Project Community: To us

496
00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:37.350
Randall Ness: Well, why don't we

497
00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:41.100
Randall Ness: You know, you could schedule his time.

498
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.910
Open Mainframe Project Community: You have a link

499
00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:43.560
Randall Ness: Calendar.

500
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:45.960
Sandy Peresie: Don't think so.

501
00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.040
Open Mainframe Project Community: You know, whether

502
00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:49.710
Open Mainframe Project Community: It's in an email from him.

503
00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:51.450
Open Mainframe Project Community: I will send you an email.

504
00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:56.580
Open Mainframe Project Community: With an at the bottom of the email.

505
00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.450
Open Mainframe Project Community: Signature has his calendar.

506
00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:01.320
Okay.

507
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:13.110
Open Mainframe Project Community: And I think that's probably the easiest way.

508
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:17.220
Open Mainframe Project Community: Get something set up with him. Okay.

509
00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:18.060
Okay.

510
00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:22.050
Open Mainframe Project Community: Excellent.

511
00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:26.040
Open Mainframe Project Community: Next topic then

512
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:34.440
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think it was on to yo performance engine. Okay.

513
00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:49.050
GillianHannington: Yes, so we're still we're still working on testing and changes we did for 64 bit support and will be particularly focusing on

514
00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:50.310
GillianHannington: Customer exits.

515
00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:51.000
GillianHannington: Which need to

516
00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:59.880
GillianHannington: Be upgraded for the 64 bit support. And that's still ongoing, because there's a there's quite a lot of customer customer. Customer exits there.

517
00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:11.760
GillianHannington: And we've also. So for the latest version. The, the extra reports that you get generated it's significantly changed from previous versions. So

518
00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:16.260
GillianHannington: So we decided that we should press document.

519
00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:21.090
GillianHannington: You know what the what is actually displaying it's much more. It's much easier to understand the new report.

520
00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:24.660
GillianHannington: But it's still need some documentation to explain it. So we've been working on that.

521
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:27.240
GillianHannington: And also documentation.

522
00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:29.550
GillianHannington: Describing

523
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.310
GillianHannington: The extra job parameters.

524
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:39.600
GillianHannington: And what else also one of our team members is retiring. So we've been making sure

525
00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:42.450
GillianHannington: To get knowledge transfer, particularly of

526
00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:49.290
GillianHannington: X IC K x IC K exit and the customer exits said he's got knowledge of

527
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:53.340
GillianHannington: And that's, that's pretty much been the last two weeks.

528
00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:54.480
Open Mainframe Project Community: That's very good.

529
00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:58.230
Open Mainframe Project Community: Can I ask

530
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:13.470
Open Mainframe Project Community: Kind of a different topic. He didn't mention there yet. We're just to update me on the latest thinking around us. We've decided that on if I'm, if I remember correctly.

531
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:28.650
Open Mainframe Project Community: And not carry forward the DB to V Sam read approach is that right that we we decided that we should not be releasing that as part of our open source code.

532
00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:37.590
Open Mainframe Project Community: Just because those data formats in dB to have changed for underlying for the newer versions of dB to and we'd rather go a different route.

533
00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:39.690
Open Mainframe Project Community: Right, yeah.

534
00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:44.220
GillianHannington: Well, I think that's, I mean that's an IBM

535
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:50.220
GillianHannington: It's not generally release knowledge that the the the internals of

536
00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:57.780
GillianHannington: DB to and how it works with the sound. So that's proprietary knowledge there so that we can. We can't release that

537
00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:06.390
Open Mainframe Project Community: You're right. And just, just so you just give you a little bit of history on that job. It was it was generally no knowledge when it was coated

538
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:09.300
Randall Ness: Doug

539
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:10.350
Open Mainframe Project Community: Doug going out and he

540
00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:14.460
Open Mainframe Project Community: Read the manuals, which were available publicly

541
00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:20.100
Open Mainframe Project Community: In 1995 Randall. I don't know.

542
00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.770
Open Mainframe Project Community: And and so but

543
00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:29.520
Open Mainframe Project Community: Since then, you know, it's just not something that is done very much. So what

544
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:33.180
GillianHannington: Does manuals and now not publicly available.

545
00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:37.230
GillianHannington: It's as if they've they've decided that they're not going to release that information.

546
00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:38.760
Open Mainframe Project Community: Well, it's probably because Doug

547
00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:43.290
Neil Beesley: And the former

548
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:44.910
Neil Beesley: Things change and it's

549
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:49.050
Randall Ness: You know, it becomes a an overhead to

550
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:50.460
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yes.

551
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:54.120
Neil Beesley: Putting that information out. There's probably some other things we could do.

552
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:55.590
Yesterday,

553
00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:59.430
Open Mainframe Project Community: When you speak to that for a moment. What, what's your sense about

554
00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:00.930
Open Mainframe Project Community: WHAT THE OTHER THINGS ARE WE COULD DO

555
00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:05.070
Neil Beesley: Something that could actually translate

556
00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:07.290
Neil Beesley: I don't know whether Randall wants to

557
00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:11.700
Neil Beesley: preempt anything. I'm gonna say here, but

558
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:25.680
Neil Beesley: Something that could translate to different databases as well, would be the unload database, the high speed database and in terms of DP to there's a high speed database unload yes

559
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:29.760
Neil Beesley: And if we could harness that then we don't need to

560
00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.110
Randall Ness: Either the

561
00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:46.530
Neil Beesley: Organization has dB to or they don't have it or they have add a bass or they don't have it or they have you know idea mess or they don't have it. And we just latch onto the exit that comes with a product and say, hey,

562
00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:50.040
Neil Beesley: Unload some data for us into memory.

563
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:54.750
Open Mainframe Project Community: Feed feed feed me as you feed the data to me right

564
00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.730
Neil Beesley: Yeah, in memory, not not land with

565
00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:57.780
Neil Beesley: Data, but yeah.

566
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:04.020
Open Mainframe Project Community: It's all we would basically be replacing

567
00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:06.720
Open Mainframe Project Community: GV V, Mr dv.

568
00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:10.170
Open Mainframe Project Community: With the unloading joints.

569
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:12.990
Neil Beesley: Yeah, but we just

570
00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:18.720
Neil Beesley: Very high level because I've only spent about 90 minutes reading up on that.

571
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:21.060
Open Mainframe Project Community: So, no, no, it's good, I think.

572
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:35.610
Open Mainframe Project Community: That and I didn't mean to take it down. You've got a lot of stuff going on here. I just thought maybe I'd asked that question around that one piece of it because I think it's relevant for for continuing discussions here so that's

573
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:40.830
Randall Ness: Yes. Okay. Like, I guess my idea for how we're going to do this as

574
00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:47.550
Randall Ness: Long term, we would try to do something with the high performance on LOAD Utility as Neil had suggested

575
00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:54.930
Randall Ness: And we do want to extract out the existing code from our

576
00:57:56.130 --> 00:58:04.140
Randall Ness: From our source repository, so that this doesn't end up in the the open source all the stuff that describes what the underlying V San files look like

577
00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:18.630
Randall Ness: That hasn't been as high priority is getting some of the other things done for our customers. So right now the current safir version has all that stuff in it. We were thinking for the short term for anything for open source we would just

578
00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:28.500
Randall Ness: Remove that entry from the code table. So the workbench wouldn't see it and then people wouldn't be able to select it in the open source version, or at least the

579
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:36.810
Randall Ness: The workbench that we're putting out there that's maybe not quite open source yet, but we are contributors to start playing with it.

580
00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:39.870
Randall Ness: Okay, excellent.

581
00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:45.600
Open Mainframe Project Community: Any other comments, questions from anybody else on this topic.

582
00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:50.910
Okay, excellent.

583
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.800
Open Mainframe Project Community: Hey, Bob.

584
00:58:53.610 --> 00:58:55.710
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yes, Mike, you have to speak again here.

585
00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:56.970
bobmcCormack: Oh, good. I

586
00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:00.720
Open Mainframe Project Community: Infrastructure update

587
00:59:01.410 --> 00:59:02.490
bobmcCormack: Yeah, sure. I'm

588
00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:06.660
Randall Ness: Acting on Randalls instructions.

589
00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:17.280
bobmcCormack: We need to look at how we can synchronize work within get and work with an RTC at the source code level. So we've done a test where

590
00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.980
bobmcCormack: We've created a an RTC

591
00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:29.790
bobmcCormack: Workspace. And then we've done a get clone onto the same machine and then we've manually copied the parts across assemble macros.

592
00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:30.660
Randall Ness: Copy, etc.

593
00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:50.070
bobmcCormack: From the get clone directory into the RTC workspace and then we've checked the RTC workspace back into RTC and also delivered it and then we've looked at it in the stream with an RTC and that looks fine. No conversion issues and the

594
00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:51.810
Randall Ness: Data reflects what

595
00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:52.320
Was

596
00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:54.210
bobmcCormack: In

597
00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:55.050
Randall Ness: The GitHub.

598
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:56.760
bobmcCormack: SEM instance

599
00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:02.070
bobmcCormack: So that's pleasing. It's a manual process because of the different folder structures.

600
01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:04.920
bobmcCormack: And part names, but maybe every

601
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:06.000
Randall Ness: Time we can come up with the

602
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.390
bobmcCormack: Script. So there's that I'm still getting issues, trying to do a good client using Yes hi john Viacom

603
01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:18.540
bobmcCormack: I'll get that fixed. One day the GV be liberal

604
01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:21.270
bobmcCormack: Repository in Geneva.

605
01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:29.220
bobmcCormack: ERS is now merged into the master branch and thank you for the person that committed it approved it rather

606
01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:30.750
So that's done.

607
01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.650
bobmcCormack: We did strike an issue with spark.

608
01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.480
bobmcCormack: Because the initial

609
01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:38.460
bobmcCormack: Zoom.

610
01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:45.660
bobmcCormack: Platform for spark was discontinued the software product was discontinued by IBM and the product itself is now.

611
01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:46.650
bundled with

612
01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:50.730
bobmcCormack: IBM open data analytics.

613
01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:51.210
bobmcCormack: Zed.

614
01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.460
bobmcCormack: Which is a priced product.

615
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:54.960
bobmcCormack: is unfortunate.

616
01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:55.890
So,

617
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:58.950
bobmcCormack: Lead that one would you keep

618
01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:03.990
bobmcCormack: By sent you the name of the product owner, maybe there might be some synergy down the track. I don't know.

619
01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.160
Open Mainframe Project Community: So, so, Bob.

620
01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.710
Open Mainframe Project Community: I like that. And I saw your email have been able to act.

621
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:08.520
Open Mainframe Project Community: On that what

622
01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:10.680
Open Mainframe Project Community: What would

623
01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.650
Open Mainframe Project Community: You suggest, I say, how would

624
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:16.320
Open Mainframe Project Community: Attack this discussion.

625
01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:19.680
bobmcCormack: Yeah. Um, I don't know how populace back

626
01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:25.620
bobmcCormack: On sources. Maybe they could be desperate for some proof of concept or some

627
01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:30.930
bobmcCormack: Something they could ship themselves. I don't know. Or they could provide a

628
01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:34.230
bobmcCormack: Portion of spark to you or

629
01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:36.000
bobmcCormack: In open systems.

630
01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:38.610
bobmcCormack: Maybe just need to explore the envelope there.

631
01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:40.980
bobmcCormack: I don't know if there's anything from it.

632
01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:53.910
bobmcCormack: Because you could say will spark itself is open source. So why is IBM putting it inside a prize product. It should maybe be still separate and then

633
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:57.240
bobmcCormack: Usable so

634
01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.060
bobmcCormack: This, I don't see a

635
01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:01.380
bobmcCormack: Golden yeah

636
01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:03.270
Open Mainframe Project Community: No, no that's that's helpful.

637
01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.170
bobmcCormack: That's helped me

638
01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:11.970
Open Mainframe Project Community: Right there, that comment. Right. Isn't that relevant because listen, we're trying to drive experimentation on the platform and

639
01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:12.960
We've taken a step.

640
01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.360
Open Mainframe Project Community: To to inhibit that

641
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:18.000
bobmcCormack: With this choice. Why did we take

642
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.110
Open Mainframe Project Community: That step what what

643
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.430
Open Mainframe Project Community: are we hoping to achieve in

644
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:21.420
Randall Ness: That step.

645
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:23.250
Open Mainframe Project Community: Is kind of the question you

646
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:23.700
Open Mainframe Project Community: Helped me

647
01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:24.600
Form. Yeah.

648
01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.310
bobmcCormack: And maybe their sales aren't that good. I don't know.

649
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.470
Open Mainframe Project Community: Well, but

650
01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:35.670
Open Mainframe Project Community: This is is that is that the answer to that.

651
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.350
Randall Ness: That problem. I

652
01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.190
Open Mainframe Project Community: It's hard.

653
01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:39.840
Open Mainframe Project Community: It's hard to imagine that is

654
01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:41.520
Open Mainframe Project Community: For me, but yeah. Okay.

655
01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.060
bobmcCormack: Good.

656
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:45.090
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yeah. But that gives me the right question to be asking

657
01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:45.810
Open Mainframe Project Community: Of that and

658
01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:59.310
bobmcCormack: The other aspect is some for spark processing is the large amount of data for it to be tested with such as from data world, which is the state of Virginia.

659
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:05.280
bobmcCormack: financial data. So what we were working with Randall, we sat down and we did an analysis of

660
01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.680
bobmcCormack: The space on the Viacom system.

661
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:20.160
bobmcCormack: And a bit tight on you assess and it looks rather fat on the MDS side of the house. So we did a trial of moving data from data world via windows unzipping in

662
01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.110
Randall Ness: The UNIX system services.

663
01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.110
bobmcCormack: And then copy it across to me. Yes, using

664
01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:35.370
bobmcCormack: A utility with a conversion sub parameter and that all seemed to go. OK. So the that that that path is usable.

665
01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:49.950
bobmcCormack: It's a fair bit of data right spit suspect more north of 10 gig or more, but we just gotta wait at the moment, till we get some sort of direction where the spark is going to, you know, ignite or not.

666
01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.290
bobmcCormack: So that's my last diatribe today.

667
01:03:55.710 --> 01:04:04.050
Open Mainframe Project Community: That's not little that's a substantial just like everyone before you. This is me just say this is I've been kind of

668
01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:10.470
Open Mainframe Project Community: A wall. Like I said, for a little bit and joining up here and hearing

669
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:13.440
Open Mainframe Project Community: The progress and the focus on exactly the right things is just

670
01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:14.820
Randall Ness: encouraging to me.

671
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:16.530
Randall Ness: We

672
01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:22.260
Neil Beesley: read data from me. So do we have to read it from the USS CSS file.

673
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.590
bobmcCormack: It depends on the script.

674
01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:30.900
bobmcCormack: So we could you know do it with pointing to the the DD

675
01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:32.280
bobmcCormack: In the script or pointing

676
01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.420
bobmcCormack: It to the USS

677
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:35.610
bobmcCormack: folder so

678
01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.350
bobmcCormack: Now this that

679
01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:42.090
Open Mainframe Project Community: Spices always a problem you're using, but you're talking there.

680
01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.670
Open Mainframe Project Community: About spark specifically are we talking about JS.

681
01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:45.240
Randall Ness: OS.

682
01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.820
Open Mainframe Project Community: As an access crunch probably spark.

683
01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:50.880
bobmcCormack: Thinking in your scripts that

684
01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.620
bobmcCormack: Invoke Scala.

685
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.670
bobmcCormack: To invoke spark.

686
01:04:54.300 --> 01:05:01.110
bobmcCormack: Yeah, are you does I'm not familiar with the PSC for Spark doesn't rely on the MDS s

687
01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:03.510
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think it is. I think

688
01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:04.710
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think, I think.

689
01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:05.280
Randall Ness: That's the

690
01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:06.390
bobmcCormack: primary way that

691
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:07.710
bobmcCormack: You have been marketing.

692
01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:08.910
Open Mainframe Project Community: It's Jesus

693
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.530
Open Mainframe Project Community: And

694
01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.670
Open Mainframe Project Community: So yeah, we, you can use

695
01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:15.420
Randall Ness: Scala.

696
01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:16.860
Open Mainframe Project Community: That goes directly without

697
01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:18.810
Open Mainframe Project Community: There's no spark access directly

698
01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:21.210
Open Mainframe Project Community: To Jay's ass but again that's a license.

699
01:05:21.690 --> 01:05:28.950
Open Mainframe Project Community: That's part of the j in the Java NZ licenses license there, but it does leave the spark tissue somewhat separate

700
01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:32.640
Us.

701
01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:35.970
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yes. Yeah, if we have to go that route.

702
01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:42.000
bobmcCormack: Oh, and the other comment. I should have added in there was some

703
01:05:43.650 --> 01:05:51.120
bobmcCormack: Craig books, one of our developers down here is a liaising with the HR high level assembler chap in Winchester.

704
01:05:51.840 --> 01:06:09.780
bobmcCormack: And it's good progress so shortly. Mom, hoping that we'll have a PDF for that out for the high level assembly toolkit so that all neva lost in the short term to assemble. You are 20 on Viacom once they put the PDF on so that's pleasing.

705
01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:13.830
Open Mainframe Project Community: Excellent. Actually, that raises the question for me.

706
01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:30.750
Open Mainframe Project Community: Have we had any progress meal on making contact with our the guy that's more the recruiting recruiting are specific individual in Perth that we want. Who's has Jay and I experience with assembler, but we made any progress on that recruiting effort specifically

707
01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:35.250
Neil Beesley: on LinkedIn and send a few messages, nothing.

708
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.230
Open Mainframe Project Community: Because he never checked LinkedIn.

709
01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.680
Neil Beesley: He might be one of these people that

710
01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:47.970
Except one on

711
01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:59.790
Open Mainframe Project Community: One well. Okay, then let's let's let's continue to work that specific recruiting

712
01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:00.900
Randall Ness: Effort and

713
01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:06.480
Open Mainframe Project Community: Maybe we should get Sandy's very good at recruiting. Maybe we needed sandy down to Perth to

714
01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:07.980
Do this work.

715
01:07:09.690 --> 01:07:11.370
Ian: You talked about David Stevens.

716
01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:12.750
Neil Beesley: Yeah yeah yeah

717
01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:17.820
Randall Ness: Isn't

718
01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:19.710
Ian: Isn't IBM. Uh, yeah.

719
01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:22.110
Open Mainframe Project Community: We need to we need to invite him to the next.

720
01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:23.580
Randall Ness: TLC will will

721
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:27.810
Neil Beesley: Will have a work session. I don't know what the reason IBM anymore.

722
01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.130
Ian: Now he's now.

723
01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.720
Neil Beesley: He's an IBM

724
01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.840
Neil Beesley: Historically, yeah.

725
01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:39.660
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yes. Yeah, but he's where we don't care. We'd love. This is an open source community.

726
01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:40.590
Neil Beesley: Yeah yeah

727
01:07:42.210 --> 01:07:44.040
Neil Beesley: Yeah, but ya know

728
01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:44.910
Randall Ness: For definitely

729
01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:50.670
Neil Beesley: It's just I haven't had any success. I've had more success with them call has been helping me

730
01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:54.900
Open Mainframe Project Community: Yes. That's excellent. Okay, there's progress. That's good.

731
01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:11.040
Open Mainframe Project Community: Okay, we already did the I think some of the spark update and the Randall of icon update. So on Andrea's issue here. She said something something dash kip

732
01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:21.540
Open Mainframe Project Community: I think. So we're down to the last five minutes of our session. So I'm supposed to say something. Let me, let me just, you know, kind of, in conclusion,

733
01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:31.950
Open Mainframe Project Community: Like I said, just a minute ago. This is great activity. I love hearing what we're working on the successes were having the issues were running into we're running into issues.

734
01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:40.710
Open Mainframe Project Community: And all the issues we're running into are the right issues to be running into their things we want to bust through the things we want to solve the things we want to improve. We want to fix.

735
01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:57.060
Open Mainframe Project Community: So the issues having issues is not a problem because if you don't, if you don't run into issues you're not really making any progress on anything meaningful. So this is I i I'm enjoying being part of these this group and and the work we're doing

736
01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:06.540
Open Mainframe Project Community: Any other concluding thoughts, any, any questions, any other items Andrea anything I missed

737
01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.540
Andrea Orth: Um, nothing that I can think of. Okay.

738
01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:16.470
Open Mainframe Project Community: I went through your agenda. You can steer me wherever I go.

739
01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:18.900
Andrea Orth: Well, we only have four minutes so

740
01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:25.650
Open Mainframe Project Community: Very, very, very good.

741
01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:31.530
Open Mainframe Project Community: Okay. Two weeks from now we'll meet again and that will be followed by the

742
01:09:31.530 --> 01:09:32.310
Randall Ness: Infrastructure meeting.

743
01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:39.450
Ian: And Andrea drop me a line. If you want to organize the time

744
01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:40.740
Ian: In the next

745
01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:42.510
Ian: Couple of days.

746
01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:44.850
Andrea Orth: Yes.

747
01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:48.720
Sandy Peresie: Oh, I do have one of one more update I forgot. I'm sorry.

748
01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:53.520
Sandy Peresie: I meant to put it on the thing I I attended the Zoe.

749
01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:59.070
Sandy Peresie: Technical steering committee meeting today and introduce myself.

750
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:04.110
Sandy Peresie: And they've offered, you know, if we want to

751
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:06.810
Sandy Peresie: Walk through or anything. Um,

752
01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:28.710
Sandy Peresie: You know, they're more than happy to walk us through whatever you know they're doing. Um, but basically they had brought up a couple of packages that they're using or planning on using for their code. And I think we probably want to look into these packages, um, for open source third there.

753
01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:35.760
Sandy Peresie: Things like Sonar. Sonar cube.

754
01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:45.900
Sandy Peresie: Coverity and sonic alright to do checking to make sure there's no issues with the code or putting out

755
01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.600
Sandy Peresie: Is anybody word have any of those things.

756
01:10:51.150 --> 01:10:55.200
Ian: I've used the sono on in disguise. IBM hundred products.

757
01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:59.970
Ian: I have temporary license for the

758
01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:01.350
Randall Ness: Rub

759
01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.450
Ian: Some of that stuff and scans everything

760
01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.070
Ian: That really annoying.

761
01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:08.070
Ian: But yeah

762
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:11.280
Ian: Good to use something like that.

763
01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:15.570
Andrea Orth: Yeah, my employer uses the Sonar. Sonar cube.

764
01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:18.210
Sandy Peresie: Okay, so, um,

765
01:11:18.450 --> 01:11:19.740
Sandy Peresie: That's an open source right

766
01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:27.150
Sandy Peresie: I don't know, I haven't really I haven't really looked into any of them, but

767
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:30.780
Sandy Peresie: I know that Coverity someone brought that up today.

768
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:34.020
Sandy Peresie: Um, you know, I think.

769
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:49.260
Sandy Peresie: I think we probably at some point in time, want to want to make a recommendation that, you know, things have to be something has to be used to make sure that we have good code being built right

770
01:11:51.180 --> 01:12:00.180
Open Mainframe Project Community: In you have brought this up before sandy my comments and my prototype spark code. We're not adequate. So you have right to continue to bring this up.

771
01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:03.960
Open Mainframe Project Community: Because I haven't fixed my comments in the spark code yet.

772
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:07.020
Sandy Peresie: Yeah, this is about that. I don't think this does

773
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:13.770
Sandy Peresie: Comments, though I think it does more, you know, testing for vulnerabilities and I know we talked about black duck last time.

774
01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:30.030
Sandy Peresie: You know, but this is, this isn't this actually runs against the log files are the builds the actual build file. Yeah, so it just something to think about. You know, I know we're not there yet, but it's something to think about. I'm gonna look into that Coverity

775
01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:30.840
Randall Ness: Um,

776
01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:39.480
Sandy Peresie: And I think we'd probably have a, an expert here on sonar if it's free. We should probably be doing that, um,

777
01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:42.630
Sandy Peresie: And then there's snack to

778
01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:47.970
Andrea Orth: Right there, there is a free and open source version of some argue

779
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:52.350
Sandy Peresie: Okay.

780
01:12:53.190 --> 01:12:56.220
Ian: I'm just, it's also a tool called cold.

781
01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.860
Ian: Oh it scans your Java looking for

782
01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:03.960
Ian: For errors.

783
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:05.160
Yeah.

784
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:13.260
Ian: Spot errors and there's a great little plugin so you can run it as part of your build as well.

785
01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.830
Ian: Spot hero something that's called something like oh

786
01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:22.440
Sandy Peresie: Yeah, that sounds a lot like Coverity that they were talking about today. Would you would you runs as part of the build.

787
01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:39.810
Sandy Peresie: And actually there's in your in your code and stuff. Things that you know where you have like a possible bleed or something along those lines that I'm probably using the wrong, you know, memory bleed. I'm probably using the wrong terminology, because I don't know I'm Java that mature.

788
01:13:40.890 --> 01:13:45.480
Sandy Peresie: But you know, it's probably worth making sure that we have some type of a standard

789
01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:47.610
Sandy Peresie: Usage

790
01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.370
Sandy Peresie: When people start to contribute.

791
01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:52.050
Ian: Sure.

792
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.880
Ian: I think an

793
01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:56.220
Ian: Initial

794
01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:08.010
Ian: Release of code, we could well say, yeah, this is it. And look at these thousands of things that get reported by these tools. That's one of the things we need to clean up.

795
01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.130
Sandy Peresie: That first dishes. I like it.

796
01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.450
Ian: Buried in all these things. Yes. Yeah.

797
01:14:22.650 --> 01:14:23.340
Sandy Peresie: Okay, that's all.

798
01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:27.570
Open Mainframe Project Community: Thank you Andy appreciate your work in that space. Sure.

799
01:14:30.930 --> 01:14:33.570
Open Mainframe Project Community: Hey, thanks everybody. Appreciate the time

800
01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:38.610
Neil Beesley: Tonight.
