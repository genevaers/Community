### TAC 10/12/23
- We need to get move from a passing badge to gold. An issue or project item will be opened on this. Criteria listing for all [OpenSSF badges](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/criteria)
  - How should we proceed here?   
    - We could create Projects in GitHub.
    - We could create Discussions in GitHub.
        - Kip: Could you create "idea" documents for the following: 
          - the MR95 looping proposal?  
          - the diagram of design options for integrating Java into our technology? 
### Project lifecycle procedures
## Infrastructure
## Run-Control Apps
- Do we need the DSNAOINI DD name (ODBC parameters) with Java MR91 (gvbrdg)? 
- Should we produce "Messages and Codes" documentation for our programs? 
  - If so, we should continue to use error codes (like GVB12345E) along with error messages in Java MR91 (gvbrdg), as we are doing with GVBMR95, etc.  
## Workbench
- Can we remove the drop-down list box that appears at the bottom of the General Properties tab when the use selects Source-Record Layout (Source-Record Copy)?  
## R&D Work
- Byte Buddy 
- Liberty - open source alternative to WebSphere.
## Performance Engine
- Aggregation functions
- MR95 parameters to support table lookups using a hashing algorithm  
- Java bytecode 
  - What is the minimum possible bytecode program we could develop?
    - "HELLO WORLD"
## Potential users (who may want support)
## Demo
## Documentation
- Technical documentation 
- "A document a week, that's all we ask" 
## Conferences 
- Possible presentation at the Winter SHARE conference 
## For next time
