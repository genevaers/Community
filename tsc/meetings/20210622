Minutes
Agenda from previous meeting adopted as agenda for current meeting
Sandy noted activity in kanban board and following points came from that observation
all the demo views are ready for review
query was raised about when to capture XML along with capturing output views coupled with querying about 'small' means for data volume
team felt it was better to await review of views first before proceeding along the capture approach
some discussion about the number of XMLs being produced from 5 to one. Due the fact that any portion of the XML is tied to the whole, one xml file was decided uon to be the best course
documentation and report outputs was then raised  after the views being reviewed, discussion flowed about currency and depth of content
Gillian has a cheat sheet (proto doc) on this doc and capture process, she will update it and pass to Eugene
Some considerations noted here were
overall doc to include LR/PF/LR
captire output reports but document wisely 
conclusion was to get demo up and running along with minimum documentation to support it
JCL to run this is in GEBT.DEMO.JCL as separate steps, Bob to supply a one job to combine all steps and notify Neil
Randall inquired on best place to put installation jobs and documentation  i.e. which repo. It was decided by voices that the executable bundle be in DEMO repo, Workbench executable will be in the WB repo
Bob to test storing this executable as a package in the DEMO repo.
Ian provided an explanation on Test Framework works and discussion following noted difference between it and an Installation and Verification test.
