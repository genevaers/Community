Sandy Peresie: What to put in slack.

27
00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.230

Randall Ness: there's any three of us over there, so we.

52
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.390
GillianHannington: thought perhaps the right thing to do is join you.

53
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:05.760
Randall Ness: Well it's kind of funny clips of slack message says might be some zoom ID confusion over attack meeting and then he gives us the same one we were already on rather than yours.

54
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.010
Randall Ness: So yeah that that added to the confusion, yes.

55
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.490
Sandy Peresie: Do we have five before.

56
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.400

Sandy Peresie: In the one he gave us.

61

hi friends.

107
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:30.600
Randall Ness: hello, I apologize for executing such a poorly planned.

108
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:31.200
Meeting.

109
00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.960
Kip Twitchell: here's here's my take on what's happened.

110
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.490
Kip Twitchell: there's calendar invites.

111
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:38.910
Randall Ness: out.

112
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.250
Kip Twitchell: There were a lot probably scheduled when we first.

113
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.690
Kip Twitchell: Created the project.

114
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:44.790
Kip Twitchell: and go well beyond the.

115
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.280
Kip Twitchell: The date of our planned.

116
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:54.540
Kip Twitchell: zoom meetings so there wasn't synchronization during the zoom meeting and calendar invite.

117
00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.110
Kip Twitchell: So there's still calendar invites out there for.

118
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:12.900
Kip Twitchell: zoom meetings that no longer are on scheduled meetings, it appears to work with this zoom meeting but it's not an officially scheduled meeting.

119
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:27.120
Kip Twitchell: sure how long the meeting before so on so forth, because it's not one that's on the official scheduled for Olympia so I made a new zoom meeting created a new calendar invite.

120
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:34.410
Kip Twitchell: But I don't have any way of calling back holy cow calendar invites that are probably on your calendars.

121
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.340
Kip Twitchell: With the old meeting ids in them.

122
00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:50.280
Sandy Peresie: Okay, so you're suggesting that I think that everybody delete all our calendar invites for Geneva ERS and you can resend it tomorrow.

123
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:57.570
Kip Twitchell: That sounds like a potential plan to me, yes Andy.

124
00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.240
Sandy Peresie: And I think that's a good plan.

125
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:01.530
Andrea Orth: Thank.

126
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:11.910
Andrea Orth: You are you wanna i'm not sure how this matter I don't know how this works, since we're not done on girl in peace, but you want a personal plan or a paid plan.

127
00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:20.160
Kip Twitchell: For so so I don't have I have I don't have a I have a personal plan, but i've been doing all my work under the O R amp D ID.

128
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.060
Kip Twitchell: or recordings and those kinds of things.

129
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.630
Andrea Orth: Right i'm just thinking of it matters, the links on the type of account you have.

130
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:38.460
Andrea Orth: That was mangled English, the link of the meeting is dependent on whether you have a paid or a free account.

131
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:46.350
Kip Twitchell: yeah and I, so I i've been scheduling everything under the O R amp T account, which is a paid account.

132
00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:47.850
Andrea Orth: Right.

133
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.430
Andrea Orth: Now, and peace.

134
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.050
Andrea Orth: Thank you, how long is this meeting, going to be do we have any idea.

135
00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:03.300
Kip Twitchell: I think I think that this meeting will probably run for the full time I that's my sense is it likely will I don't know for sure, but.

136
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.970
Kip Twitchell: I suspected well.

137
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.150
Neil Beesley: i'm going to delete.

160
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:53.340
Kip Twitchell: Particularly with with our proposal for next month, perhaps becoming a project, we still have some discussion around good first issues which.

161
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:17.850
Kip Twitchell: is tied to our blog entry, because this will be a bit of a boost for the blog post on own P may drive a little bit more activity, so we want to have some good good pieces around that and I think the other agenda item would be our repo and and our ci progress on things.

162
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:19.710
Kip Twitchell: Any.

163
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.620
Kip Twitchell: Any sense any comments on the proposed agenda now.

164
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:30.720
Ian: sounds cool.

165
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:37.140
Ian: eugene has seen the sides, by the way, and he's quite happy with it, but yeah that's fine.

166
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:47.790
Kip Twitchell: Okay, well, maybe we could put that at the tail end and if we get around to it and we could come back to that if that's okay.

167
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.460
Kip Twitchell: Okay.

168
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.100
Kip Twitchell: How about if we start.

169
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.670
Kip Twitchell: On the on the password removal activity to.

170
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.600
Kip Twitchell: Some emails have been going around and and.

171
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:13.410
Kip Twitchell: And if that has a linkage, I think, for the CIA, I think both of those seemed to me to be high priority for us to get her is that.

172
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:20.190
Ian: Basically, the the way in which we currently do passwords within the workbench.

173
00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.830
Ian: will not be blessed by the ci process.

174
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.710
Ian: We use an algorithm.

175
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:34.230
Ian: to encrypt and install the password within.

176
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:36.990
Ian: Your local machine.

177
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.820
Ian: And this is a big, no, no, in terms of ci.

178
00:22:42.840 --> 00:23:00.660
Ian: If you do have to store passwords, then what you should do is not actually store the password itself is still a hashtag version of the password using ideally the be crypt mechanism which i've investigated and kind of make work.

179
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:02.880
Ian: So.

180
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:16.680
Ian: it's a one way thing so you've not actually store the password you are just verifying that the user enters when the user enters the password it is in fact the password he entered last time.

181
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:23.760
Ian: But my proposal is to just not store passwords whatsoever.

182
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:31.110
Ian: and make the thing connect into the workbench database, just as if you were using pecan.

183
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:33.570
Ian: So you log in.

184
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.800
Ian: I don't see any benefit and actually storing the password.

185
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.630
Ian: Then there's a second level password.

186
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:50.700
Ian: That is the one that is used within the workbench itself, not the database connection it's the workbench password.

187
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.980
Ian: And that is used for.

188
00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.270
Ian: The ancient purposes of whole that group.

189
00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.920
Ian: group dynamics and protecting certain areas.

190
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:07.740
Ian: Which is all.

191
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:19.020
Ian: Painful set of code that's in the current workbench and I don't believe is necessary if we treat the workbench think of the workbench purely as an editor.

192
00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:26.580
Ian: You can start the world with a set of workbench xml files import them.

193
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:40.050
Ian: Do whatever you want to do to them is if it was if, as if you were in visual studio code you'll take a bunch of source files edit them finishing what you're editing they have them put them into.

194
00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:49.770
Ian: the likes of github or whatever source code repository and go and we if we treat our web mentioned the same mechanism.

195
00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:51.390
Ian: Then.

196
00:24:54.150 --> 00:25:00.810
Ian: We don't need any passwords whatsoever, he just log in to your stuff save your files and log out.

197
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.290
Ian: log out to disconnect.

198
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:16.830
Ian: And the fact that there's a database on the other end is just a kind of a a persistence mechanism if sharing mechanism and just leave it at that.

199
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:30.360
Kip Twitchell: Okay, in thanks for that summary, let me, let me restate just a little bit to make sure that we're on the same page right there's two levels of password we have the database connectivity password.

200
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:39.480
Kip Twitchell: Which your proposal is that, instead of us storing that in some way we simply use.

201
00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:48.450
Kip Twitchell: We allow users to type that in and connect to the database with nothing stored in in the workbench.

202
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:59.010
Kip Twitchell: there's really no loss, if I understand correctly there's no loss of functionality in that it's simply a change in the way the workbench was originally written.

203
00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:12.690
Kip Twitchell: For us to do that there's no real security implications for doing that because the user has to have some way of logging into the environment, some sort of authorization for the environment is that an okay summary.

204
00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:20.280
Ian: yeah, the only thing you do lose is currently you can open it up click the button and login because it's remembered your password.

205
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.590
Ian: And it you saves you're typing it saves you a few keystrokes.

206
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.730
Yes.

207
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:28.770
Kip Twitchell: But.

208
00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:37.740
Kip Twitchell: That requires some work on our part in order to do that so loss of that may be appropriate to move forward in.

209
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.230
Kip Twitchell: Inner development tool.

210
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:47.430
Andrea Orth: yeah well it's destined for the commercial product is that the commercial side could develop single sign on.

211
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:50.760
Kip Twitchell: Yes.

212
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.460
Kip Twitchell: It could consider them.

213
00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:02.250
Kip Twitchell: And that could be a discussion and are you making it right with our existing customers as well about.

214
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.950
Kip Twitchell: yeah options available on that side of things.

215
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:09.180
Andrea Orth: yeah right since authentication it's changed a lot since.

216
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.730
Andrea Orth: The workbench was developed.

217
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:22.020
Kip Twitchell: But that would be that may be dependent upon customers in their environments and what they would like us to do in that in that respect.

218
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:23.760
Andrea Orth: yeah.

219
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.650
Andrea Orth: But it's so commonplace that my enterprise.

220
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.720
Ian: single sign on to the mainframe.

221
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:35.160
Ian: With your.

222
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:39.960
Ian: Eight character password, and this is really a Ts or ID that it's storing.

223
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.580
Andrea Orth: My experience a single sign on is usually Microsoft like ll.

224
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.740
Ian: yeah yeah but your mainframe.

225
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.200
Randall Ness: it's your tier so password.

226
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:53.130
stored.

227
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:59.280
Andrea Orth: um well depends, where the database is going to sit down the.

228
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.010
Andrea Orth: mainframe term, it could be any platform.

229
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.140
Andrea Orth: But.

230
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.420
Andrea Orth: You could put it on a Linux based system.

231
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.070
Ian: that's true and that's where it will be for Viacom eventually I see.

232
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:19.500
Andrea Orth: But yeah you're correct I did yeah.

233
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:21.600
Kip Twitchell: I think.

234
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.110
Randall Ness: I think in terms of meeting our short term.

235
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.800
goals.

236
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.320
Kip Twitchell: i'm inclined to follow ins course for the first instance, and then we could make it more.

237
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.180
Kip Twitchell: Complex or read the sickness.

238
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:34.860
Kip Twitchell: If there's.

239
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:38.070
Kip Twitchell: needs for that relative to the DSL.

240
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.610
Randall Ness: password.

241
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.900
Kip Twitchell: For just a minute, this time I.

242
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.700
Kip Twitchell: sent other feelings about that.

243
00:28:45.330 --> 00:29:01.380
Randall Ness: I guess I seem to be missing something so so Ian with your suggestion was that, under the assumption that we would all be using our own individual databases, or would we still have the same concept of no passwords for the shared database.

244
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.880
Ian: For the shared as well yeah you'd have a login it would know who you are.

245
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:12.930
Ian: But you.

246
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:21.960
Ian: shared database, you have to log in you have to make your connection to the mainframe, but you have to enter the password for that.

247
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:35.520
Kip Twitchell: I have to be authorized randall St Louis read, I have to be authorized as a as a lead, before we were using to be to I have to be authorized as a db to use her and enter my password to connect it.

248
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:37.290
Randall Ness: To db to which.

249
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.240
Kip Twitchell: may be my tsh password.

250
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:43.950
Kip Twitchell: In, but it could be it's basically a bb to authorization isn't it.

251
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:45.210
Ian: It is the.

252
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.590
Ian: way that it's currently done.

253
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.420
Ian: An SP 13 or whatever that.

254
00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.980
Ian: uses your rock F ID the fact that you've connected in urine.

255
00:29:55.710 --> 00:30:02.580
Ian: Because there's an external authorization managed in some magic way that I don't understand Bob understand that stuff.

256
00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:10.320
bobmcCormack: it's under the covers apart from being a tsa user ID that user ID has been given grant.

257
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.840
bobmcCormack: Access to the specific database.

258
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.800
as well.

259
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.900
Kip Twitchell: Yes, randall didn't answer your question.

260
00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:23.880
Randall Ness: yeah yeah Thank you.

261
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.800
Kip Twitchell: So we're just suggesting that you're going.

262
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:26.070
Randall Ness: That.

263
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.950
Kip Twitchell: Users will have to type that password in.

264
00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:31.170
Kip Twitchell: When they're presented with.

265
00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:33.600
Kip Twitchell: The current workbench.

266
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:41.910
Ian: that's Part One

267
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:43.440
Kip Twitchell: that's Part One

268
00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:45.240
Okay.

269
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:48.360
Kip Twitchell: Then, if we go to Part two

270
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:51.660
Kip Twitchell: there's the all the internal.

271
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:53.670
Randall Ness: Geneva ERS.

272
00:30:53.700 --> 00:31:01.740
Kip Twitchell: Security capability capabilities which i'm not i'm not sure are they utilized.

273
00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:09.690
Kip Twitchell: Much anymore for determining environments, you can get to and metadata you can update and that sort of thing.

274
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:20.010
Ian: One of our customers uses them on they still have them in the commercial version, not the have currently got but going ahead, do we really want that I don't know.

275
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.190
Andrea Orth: I don't think so because get will handle that in.

276
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.200
Andrea Orth: The future as part of the build process.

277
00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.380
Ian: That there is, I was talking to.

278
00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.080
Ian: sandy earlier.

279
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.500
That.

280
00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:37.140
Ian: that there will be the way we might currently manage things.

281
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.800
Ian: it's kind of awkward in that.

282
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:41.880
We don't have.

283
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:55.050
Ian: Guaranteed consistency between laws in different views, etc, because it does not exist as an entity and its own right.

284
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:59.520
Kip Twitchell: Let me, let me restate that in another way of thinking about this is, we have.

285
00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:05.490
Kip Twitchell: we've recognized that building a source code management inside of the ERS is a high bar for.

286
00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:05.760
Randall Ness: us.

287
00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.660
Kip Twitchell: To try to do.

288
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:21.630
Kip Twitchell: And so, over time, we have recognized relying upon an external source code management tool using gv ERS xml is a more pleasant more cost effective means to get to true.

289
00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:39.900
Kip Twitchell: source code management changes and so these feature sets engineer vrs they're 20 years old i've been declining in use, because we're moving more and more towards using external tooling for source code management is that an okay way of saying.

290
00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:46.170
Ian: yeah it is, but the problem is that our packaging of the xml.

291
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:59.400
Ian: is not helpful in in the sense of you can create a view that uses a la one and I created a view that uses LM one and we're happy we both got our individual.

292
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:11.460
Ian: views, but then, when someone someone one of us changes they'll one and change it to that when the data sets might change buying your view may not no longer work.

293
00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:12.720
But you don't know.

294
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:20.670
Ian: That your lie is still in your context, not mine and you don't know that it's changed necessarily.

295
00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.760
Kip Twitchell: Yes, and that would be true.

296
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:30.240
Kip Twitchell: In for any source code management tool that contains a structure of some kind right.

297
00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:30.660
Kip Twitchell: sure.

298
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.470
Ian: To but if.

299
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.170
Ian: If the alarm was was an entity on its own.

300
00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:41.190
Ian: Then i've changed the law and you get to see that it's changed in the source code and when you build your thing.

301
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:49.350
Ian: you'll see all of that it was no different to what it was the last time you used it, but we haven't got that mechanism.

302
00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.580
Andrea Orth: might be a good approach down the road.

303
00:33:53.910 --> 00:34:02.160
Ian: yeah when we get a language well, that will be what it'll be but we we that's a stepping stone along the way, is to just.

304
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.240
Ian: have to understand what you've what you're dealing with.

305
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:17.010
Kip Twitchell: yeah no I agree to your point there right it's a it's a it's something we would certainly want to fix in the language aspect of building a new interface.

306
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.000
Kip Twitchell: But you're suggesting in the short run.

307
00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:38.220
Kip Twitchell: Are by eliminating by not mean I guess Are you suggesting we wouldn't maintain the Security Code in the current workbench around these kinds of things that not necessarily removed that code.

308
00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:41.430
Kip Twitchell: conversion.

309
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.270
Ian: That the the prompt for doing this is the password.

310
00:34:47.130 --> 00:35:01.050
Ian: If if we want to retain this then we're going to have to put the password management system by storing be encrypted password in the database, so that.

311
00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:12.810
Ian: it's not visible and no one can see what your password is the argument when you look at the when you do some reading by the The argument is that.

312
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:24.810
Ian: you're lazy and we'll use the same password everywhere, so if I create a system where it's easy to get your password I have now given, given the world access to your password for everything.

313
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:25.890
Yes.

314
00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:27.450
Ian: So.

315
00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:39.060
Kip Twitchell: But, but so if I if I just took it and roll that forward right your suggestion is that we would disable the prompt for the password in the current workbench.

316
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.970
Kip Twitchell: And by doing that it.

317
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:47.430
Kip Twitchell: Would disable this set of code from doing much is that a reasonable thing yeah.

318
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:53.070
Ian: You just don't need the protection things at all effectively everywhere, you would be an administrator.

319
00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.240
Kip Twitchell: feelings about that.

320
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:33.900
Randall Ness: yeah I kind of wish Michael were on this call, Michael Shapiro understands how one of our clients is using this these features and i'm wondering how they would feel about losing these features.

321
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.130
Ian: they're not losing them because they don't have dispersion.

322
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:44.160
Randall Ness: Well yeah that's true, I guess, I was thinking that this should be.

323
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:51.930
Randall Ness: Sufficient sufficiently general enough to be able to handle new users and the existing users, but maybe that's too.

324
00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:53.580
Randall Ness: But.

325
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.100
Ian: we're also taking out things like copy.

326
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:56.790
reports.

327
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.350
Randall Ness: Well, you know that's true you got a point there got me.

328
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:02.580
Randall Ness: got.

329
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.730
Ian: So, if we take those at the end of last that's.

330
00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:06.840
Facility.

331
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:13.890
Kip Twitchell: I mean basically we're where we are breaking the rule of backwards compatibility right.

332
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:15.930
Randall Ness: And this is another.

333
00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:19.890
Kip Twitchell: it's another instance of that not the first, but a second instance of that random.

334
00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:23.220
Ian: But my my email was was.

335
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:24.060
Ian: That we.

336
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:27.810
Ian: We changed the whole view of what the workbench is.

337
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:30.600
Ian: The workbench is really an editor.

338
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:45.960
Kip Twitchell: Well, I want to, but but to that point and I still think there's value we have this discussion, a few months ago right it's there has, we have feedback that there's.

339
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:56.820
Kip Twitchell: That there is value in a workbench like interface for specifying Geneva ERS and we don't want to throw out the baby with the bathwater.

340
00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.220
Kip Twitchell: going to a luxury is the right thing.

341
00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:14.610
Kip Twitchell: So we want to maintain the editor capability, the workbench, but I can certainly see value in simplifying that code base particularly these kinds of aligners.

342
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.090
Kip Twitchell: tasks that are headed in it.

343
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:25.680
Ian: Even if we went to align which I think would be nice to have a facility, where you could graphically sure what that language was doing for you.

344
00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:46.050
Kip Twitchell: Yes, and I could envision you know, we do have cases where customers have built simplified view creation processes for business, the workbench provides a basis for perhaps enhancing and building more of that, so there are use cases we've seen in the past for that sort of thing sure.

345
00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:56.700
Andrea Orth: I have some questions and a comment so regarding that particular commercial customer i'm.

346
00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:02.670
Andrea Orth: i'm all code has to go through modern SEM.

347
00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:04.770
Andrea Orth: So.

348
00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:06.660
Having that customer.

349
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:08.430
Andrea Orth: use.

350
00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:16.110
Andrea Orth: A modern SEM is something they're already trained to do they're used to doing this is we just add.

351
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:18.450
Andrea Orth: It would just change.

352
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:23.460
Andrea Orth: To the workbench not handling that.

353
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:41.640
Andrea Orth: um so my questions are Is anybody capturing some of this stuff for like ideas to maybe later put in the commercial product or design points down the road, other than i'm not sure meeting minutes is really the best place.

354
00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:43.950
Andrea Orth: For these things.

355
00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:50.520
Andrea Orth: And if we make a decision, where is that going to get captured That way we always have some place to reference it.

356
00:39:51.630 --> 00:40:06.330
Sandy Peresie: Design decisions there's an issue out there, I can't remember what number, it is, but it's under Community so if we make a decision here, we should have captured there and I think there is a future enhancements issue out there as well.

357
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.680
Kip Twitchell: We also do have the issue under which we're discussing this right today.

358
00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:15.600
Kip Twitchell: For today's meeting which would provide us a basis for document in.

359
00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:21.180
Kip Twitchell: The past workbench pass more password removal purpose.

360
00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.630
Kip Twitchell: to your point Andrea it was.

361
00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.250
Kip Twitchell: to capture.

362
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.730
Kip Twitchell: The specifically under that I think.

363
00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:40.020
Kip Twitchell: So what's our sense, how do we move forward.

364
00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:48.870
Kip Twitchell: On this too we consider a tentative approval, pending a bit of more feedback from the extended community.

365
00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:03.330
Randall Ness: i'd be comfortable with just approving it do we need to actually I mean do we have a vote, or do we need to schedule a vote or what well.

366
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.330
Kip Twitchell: Like you know I had randall you were the one that asked for.

367
00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.450
Kip Twitchell: Michael feedback, but if you feel.

368
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:11.310
Kip Twitchell: comfortable where we're moving in.

369
00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:12.270
Randall Ness: that's that's.

370
00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:13.200
Kip Twitchell: helpful feeling.

371
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:24.570
Randall Ness: I said that before you reminded me that we're already changing this and diverging from the the client workbench so I retract my concern good.

372
00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:25.740
Kip Twitchell: Thank you for them.

373
00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:28.350
Kip Twitchell: So.

374
00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:33.480
Kip Twitchell: team anyone that's a computer on.

375
00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.700
Kip Twitchell: That we have a proposal.

376
00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:36.420
and

377
00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.420
Andrea Orth: What specifically, are we going to do.

378
00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.640
Kip Twitchell: Is we're going to to.

379
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:43.380
Andrea Orth: Two proposals and.

380
00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.020
Kip Twitchell: I would suggest we.

381
00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:48.930
Kip Twitchell: We propose two things one.

382
00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.220
Kip Twitchell: That we have to type in.

383
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.200
Kip Twitchell: Our our database.

384
00:41:52.410 --> 00:42:00.600
Kip Twitchell: password access, rather than having it stored in the workbench and to that we disable the safford Geneva.

385
00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:07.980
Kip Twitchell: Work password prompt which disables the security features for my.

386
00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.860
Kip Twitchell: grading and and such inside the database.

387
00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:21.720
Kip Twitchell: And look to the editor to become more of just a something that takes in xml edits and and exports xml for storage someplace else.

388
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:24.840
Kip Twitchell: Is that an okay summary.

389
00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:32.070
Kip Twitchell: Do I have a proposal that we should go for that.

390
00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:36.990
GillianHannington: Well, I approve.

391
00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:39.690
Kip Twitchell: Okay, so.

392
00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:44.250
Kip Twitchell: Any any any of those in favor say Aye.

393
00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.140
Kip Twitchell: Aye.

394
00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:48.390
Kip Twitchell: Any disapproval.

395
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:52.800
Kip Twitchell: Okay, in.

396
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:57.930
Kip Twitchell: Central work day starting, could I ask you to update that issue.

397
00:42:59.010 --> 00:42:59.940
Kip Twitchell: With that summary.

398
00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:02.700
Kip Twitchell: issue number.

399
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:06.090
Kip Twitchell: 2999 yep.

400
00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.220
Kip Twitchell: So that we can then.

401
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:13.530
Ian: We can possible I will do it makes me think of gets matson was the here that whatever like.

402
00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:21.900
Ian: 9999 shows my age isn't it yep.

403
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.850
Kip Twitchell: Excellent.

404
00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:29.130
Kip Twitchell: Thank you for them.

405
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.120
Kip Twitchell: We talk about.

406
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:35.220
Kip Twitchell: briefly.

407
00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:38.790
Kip Twitchell: I did get approval from.

408
00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:41.670
Kip Twitchell: Mr Murray tech on.

409
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:45.600
Kip Twitchell: populating directly into our repo phones.

410
00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:51.300
Kip Twitchell: And where we're at on source code.

411
00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:59.910
Kip Twitchell: source code publishing to the repositories what's our sense on that.

412
00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:09.570
Randall Ness: I can tell you one thing kept regarding the performance engine Bob is waiting on me to come up with some.

413
00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:27.780
Randall Ness: specification of which exact modules end up in the final product for Geneva ERS versus staffers so i'm kind of a bottleneck at the moment i'm hoping to get to that soon i'm currently working on some clients specific issues, but should be able to get to that soon okay.

414
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:36.330
GillianHannington: Also, I was going to say on that I I spot just this week that there is a bit of work to be done.

415
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:45.840
GillianHannington: So we have some code that that reads DVD VI VI Sam and then which needs to be cleaned up before we can deliver.

416
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:52.680
Kip Twitchell: migrate, we wanted to get yeah we want to disable that in person.

417
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:57.510
GillianHannington: yeah there was a piece of code that I hadn't spotted earlier and that needs cleaning up yeah.

418
00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:58.260
Okay.

419
00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:09.390
Ian: In terms of the Java world, I have three repositories, namely the when i've called the front end which is.

420
00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:12.510
Ian: What will be Mr.

421
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:17.940
Ian: The flow analyze the lt print all done through Java.

422
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.350
Ian: The workbench and the test framework.

423
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.990
Ian: And the role.

424
00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:33.270
Ian: pretty much ready to go i've i've integrated the business of.

425
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.840
Ian: it's called rock the.

426
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.840
Ian: order to release audit tool is what rat stands for.

427
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:47.700
Ian: i've integrated that into the griddle builds for these things and.

428
00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.920
Ian: Hopefully we can make that happen, they.

429
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.490
Okay.

430
00:45:56.610 --> 00:46:02.340
Kip Twitchell: In so you're aware, we created the workbench repository yeah and.

431
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:10.050
Kip Twitchell: The and made the competitors there, we also have our seat for run control.

432
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:11.160
Kip Twitchell: Which is SP.

433
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:12.690
Ian: yep.

434
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.020
Kip Twitchell: test the test area.

435
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.500
Ian: They will be the three target areas, I guess, we can put them in.

436
00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.700
Ian: My profile proposal is that.

437
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.100
Ian: We currently have things in an IBM github.

438
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:38.490
Ian: And we're just going to draw a line in the sand and take the head and lose the issues on the history, because if you.

439
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.380
Ian: Keep the issues and the history, then you're going to get all the IBM stuff.

440
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.110
Ian: So it will be a greenfield.

441
00:46:47.910 --> 00:47:06.510
Ian: We just have to make another last check to make sure that it's all TD Bu and doesn't have customer reference things in there, I spent quite a bit of time cleaning up our test framework and making sure that none of the views that we use for tests were in fact customer views.

442
00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:10.620
Ian: And do all that again.

443
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:19.020
Kip Twitchell: Can I ask is there would be a time when we could delete the rubbish and rubbish to.

444
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:26.940
bobmcCormack: that's my job, keep that was a test of moving from IBM get to.

445
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:39.960
bobmcCormack: Geneva ERS to say how it all worked, and the same to go through Okay, we just need to tweak it so that we we go in, as in mentioned claim, with no one.

446
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.600
bobmcCormack: Another other branches.

447
00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:47.610
bobmcCormack: No issue, so we just go in Nice and clean Tom i'm up for cleaning up rubbish rubbish to.

448
00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.540
Kip Twitchell: Thank you for that.

449
00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:58.110
Kip Twitchell: So let me, let me put a bit finer point on this okay.

450
00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:08.940
Kip Twitchell: i'm going to go on to the gv ERS website I I drafted today a.

451
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.120
Kip Twitchell: blog post.

452
00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:17.850
Kip Twitchell: For our project updating goals the.

453
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:20.760
Kip Twitchell: Only NPs ps4.

454
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:40.080
Kip Twitchell: could show you this briefly as well under own pee on the blog posts they put out a little while ago news blonde they took our blog post from a few months ago.

455
00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:49.770
Kip Twitchell: On this so January 27 This was our they just took our content from last June.

456
00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:58.080
Kip Twitchell: July and there they posted that they want to do an update for that so that's what we're.

457
00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:03.750
Kip Twitchell: drafted today the areas that I drafted.

458
00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:13.350
Kip Twitchell: talked about march 15 that we're we're working hard to celebrate this milestone, by becoming a full fledged product under the Linux foundation's.

459
00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:24.360
Kip Twitchell: I then give a few points as to what we have achieved created the Community, including website get repose email list getting started guide help twice.

460
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:31.620
Kip Twitchell: A month technical Steering Committee is open to all and infrastructure meeting worked with Viacom infinity to create shared user environment.

461
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:42.180
Kip Twitchell: Remove software components in compatible with an open source community and prepared for a major code releases fleshed out architectural decisions for the coming intermediate term.

462
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:47.880
Kip Twitchell: And provided leadership per broader Olympia initiatives like the ozzy.

463
00:49:48.900 --> 00:50:00.360
Kip Twitchell: Initiative, our proposals are to release the workbench run control performance engine code basis to get hub began converting the dvr yes documentation to get home.

464
00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:13.800
Kip Twitchell: and continue to explore the deeper the Apache spark integration, I spent a month more on Apache spark sandy's comment back was probably needs to be refined a little bit more not quite clear.

465
00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:23.610
Kip Twitchell: I did that simply because I think it's one of our better marketing messages that attracts other parties to participation.

466
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:32.940
Kip Twitchell: The last thing they suggested is how do we become involved i've listed our daily scrum call and our onboarding document.

467
00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:43.470
Kip Twitchell: i'd also like to go through and get over the next couple of days, a bit more details on our.

468
00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:48.780
Kip Twitchell: Potential first case issues for initial issues.

469
00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:59.340
Kip Twitchell: Which right now they're not really somebody would read them and they wouldn't know what to do with them in some respects, we have to get to a point of code.

470
00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:19.230
Kip Twitchell: That you could point to that somebody could do something with the code so there's a there's a bit of and I don't know if we'll get the Stan by the end of the week or not, but we need to increase our documentation and our issues to create opportunities for people to to work independently.

471
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:30.120
Kip Twitchell: For example, if we had the sample performance engine acl somebody could start looking at policy definitely and see how to.

472
00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:54.330
Kip Twitchell: How to work on that editing the improving the website and that one's not too hard to figure out what to do there if we want someone who happens to know groovy cradle or other tooling we'd have to give them a bit more about what What would the prospects be in that space so.

473
00:51:56.430 --> 00:52:04.260
Kip Twitchell: Anyway, that the I guess the major point of this is that you know we're kind of making a stand here.

474
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:12.930
Kip Twitchell: Proposing to be a full fledged project project first of March are we feeling.

475
00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:20.130
Kip Twitchell: Confident we said two weeks ago we review that again, are we feeling confident in that.

476
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:23.070
Kip Twitchell: Now, with the two weeks behind us.

477
00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:39.990
bobmcCormack: Well we've got several things here keep one is the movement of the debris pros Ian is close to moving his three the framework, the test and the front end Mr naughty one.

478
00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:51.780
bobmcCormack: So we could move those across to a private external github and then john Murray tech give it its blessing, the next one is the performance engine we've.

479
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:59.910
Kip Twitchell: Just let me correct, I think we have permission from john to go straight into our Geneva urs repos and he can bless them there.

480
00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:02.610
bobmcCormack: But as private or public there.

481
00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:07.500
Kip Twitchell: I think that we'd probably be okay, he didn't specify.

482
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.500
Kip Twitchell: So I don't know that that's an issue at this point, I think he trusts us enough okay.

483
00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:16.560
bobmcCormack: So okay we'll go public so.

484
00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.380
bobmcCormack: And then the performance engine.

485
00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:33.900
bobmcCormack: At the moment, we've got it in github internal and we need to plane massage remove and update so there's a bit that's more than a week's work of.

486
00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:52.050
bobmcCormack: stuffing around and then providing a provider a nascent build process which is half done in that we can do a get clone disaster in USS and then we can load the disaster data sets from the USS but we just got to build the.

487
00:53:53.910 --> 00:54:06.900
bobmcCormack: assembly, cobalt and link at it so that's still in progress that will take a bit of time, but initially you're I think within but there's a match 15 you're saying the date.

488
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:18.390
Kip Twitchell: Well, so it would be just looking specifically right two weeks from today is march 9 would be Tuesday night attack meeting would be Thursday march 11.

489
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:24.060
Kip Twitchell: Okay, that would be the one that we would be approved on if we were targeting something before March 15.

490
00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:26.820
bobmcCormack: or on a bit tied to the performance engine.

491
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:30.180
Randall Ness: We have something we could have something there for.

492
00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:30.600
sure.

493
00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.460
bobmcCormack: Possibly could even be built, but.

494
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:41.250
Kip Twitchell: Well, and I think up to that to that point, the thing that we're going to be.

495
00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:43.980
Kip Twitchell: Looking that's going to be queried right.

496
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.880
Kip Twitchell: will be if I think of attack members they're going to go out to our github.

497
00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.770
Kip Twitchell: sites and look at our repulse.

498
00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:50.160
Kip Twitchell: Look at.

499
00:54:50.970 --> 00:55:00.150
Kip Twitchell: The code basis yep I don't think they may ask a question about builds processes yeah we could be honest in that saying hey we're.

500
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:01.650
Kip Twitchell: we're just about.

501
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:03.360
Kip Twitchell: There in those processes, we.

502
00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.520
Kip Twitchell: have the ability to give people modules.

503
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.630
Kip Twitchell: As as they request they can't build on their own, but we're.

504
00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:15.750
Kip Twitchell: So i'm not I take that as letting them judge whether we're a full fledged product.

505
00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:16.650
bobmcCormack: or not a.

506
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:23.610
Kip Twitchell: project or not, if that was something if that was kind of one of the few things that I don't think there's any shame in asking.

507
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.350
bobmcCormack: I guess my point there.

508
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:31.050
bobmcCormack: And the last item is that the badge the ci badge as it stands.

509
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:34.770
bobmcCormack: In Connie went through some of the issues with.

510
00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:35.040
bobmcCormack: me.

511
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:46.140
bobmcCormack: Last week, and I call I think at the moment we're we're green there sorry we were, we would meet the green level that is the basic entry level badge.

512
00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:59.820
bobmcCormack: So the all the buttons are green so if given our discussion with the password today in the vote i'll press the button for submit to go ahead and get a entry level ci badge.

513
00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:03.360
Kip Twitchell: I think that sounds excellent.

514
00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:07.230
Kip Twitchell: Let me, let me share here just a second all right.

515
00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:13.140
Kip Twitchell: Just to be more clear on this, if we go through the checklist in the.

516
00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:19.050
Randall Ness: In the tasc.

517
00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:25.020
Kip Twitchell: folder under Community.

518
00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:31.230
Kip Twitchell: I think the the things that we're.

519
00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:34.170
Kip Twitchell: Looking project intake.

520
00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:42.690
Kip Twitchell: Right we're this one is one that's outstanding So this was the original list from.

521
00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:49.860
Kip Twitchell: to become a project, so you should be working on this, you just highlighted right there that.

522
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:52.110
Randall Ness: And then graduation.

523
00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:55.050
Kip Twitchell: see a badge achieved.

524
00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:59.520
Kip Twitchell: committed to diversity established which, I think.

525
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.000
Kip Twitchell: We.

526
00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:03.840
Kip Twitchell: could say with with the multiple Community participants, we have.

527
00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:07.740
Kip Twitchell: would be the other piece of that.

528
00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:14.430
Kip Twitchell: This would be something that john protect us to address for the data analytics.

529
00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:37.980
Kip Twitchell: Active stage, we have to complete a proposal process have to mentors from at least two organizations core infrastructure badge for time we talked about that project governance process is established publicly said project adopters effort at least the primary week but we'll have to discuss.

530
00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:39.120
Randall Ness: That because our.

531
00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:40.170
Kip Twitchell: customers.

532
00:57:40.350 --> 00:57:41.040
Randall Ness: I don't know about their.

533
00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:43.110
Kip Twitchell: their willingness to be public.

534
00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:45.450
Kip Twitchell: So I don't know how firm that requirement is.

535
00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:48.900
Kip Twitchell: Complete a code licensing scan.

536
00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:51.720
Kip Twitchell: This again would be once we.

537
00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:54.720
Kip Twitchell: Get the code out there we've done that once with our code.

538
00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.100
Kip Twitchell: we'd have to have somebody that would represent us.

539
00:57:59.100 --> 00:57:59.850
Randall Ness: On the attack.

540
00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.090
Kip Twitchell: And we have to have a supermajority on the tech.

541
00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.940
To be moved to a project status.

542
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:09.240
Kip Twitchell: Okay.

543
00:58:11.790 --> 00:58:16.560
Kip Twitchell: But any other comments Bob was very helpful in terms of your response.

544
00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:18.180
Kip Twitchell: There other.

545
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:20.970
Kip Twitchell: Things you know about this.

546
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:22.110
Good.

547
00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:27.210
bobmcCormack: yeah it's just the practicalities of it, so the full reprise to get across.

548
00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:28.050
Randall Ness: and

549
00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:38.070
bobmcCormack: A nascent bill process so they're the things i'd look at and three of them and that ian's been working on look like they're ready to.

550
00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:39.600
bobmcCormack: travel across once he's happy.

551
00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:40.830
Randall Ness: And then.

552
00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:47.880
bobmcCormack: Just all the the due diligence on the performance engine source code so.

553
00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:49.860
bobmcCormack: But.

554
00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:54.180
Randall Ness: I think we could do it by March the 15th or sorry March the ninth.

555
00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.900
Randall Ness: So suppose that we.

556
00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:00.150
Kip Twitchell: push it sounds to me like a close enough.

557
00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:03.960
Kip Twitchell: there's no reason for us not to with bloggers, for it.

558
00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.160
Kip Twitchell: To push and see if.

559
00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:06.660
Kip Twitchell: We can do it, would you.

560
00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:08.430
Kip Twitchell: Where would everyone agree with that.

561
00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:09.120
Kip Twitchell: proposal.

562
00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:12.210
Kip Twitchell: Is that a good producers are some risk.

563
00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:13.710
Kip Twitchell: first attempt.

564
00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:21.720
Randall Ness: i'd like to clarify a little bit about what the build process needs to look at Bob you were mentioning unix system services, but at least for the short term.

565
00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:31.440
Randall Ness: couldn't we just say let's leave the build process just the way it is except for where it gets the source code like right now it's getting the source code from rtc but.

566
00:59:32.130 --> 00:59:44.580
Randall Ness: For initial cut we could just say switch that initial piece of the build process to instead get it from github and then maybe as a first step, try to rebuild everything using.

567
00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:56.880
Randall Ness: Using the local github and see if everything still works and then, once we're satisfied with that and we've cleaned up the code in the stuff that's going to move to the public github then.

568
00:59:57.510 --> 01:00:04.200
Randall Ness: That move stuff out to the public github change the pointers in our building process and then just keep doing the bill just the way we are.

569
01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:12.450
Randall Ness: And that's something I think that's doable in the short term and then over time, then make it more generic so that other people could do the same thing.

570
01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:21.090
Kip Twitchell: randall and if I were presenting to attack I would be clear about where we are on the build processes, and I would say, but listen we've had.

571
01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:21.900
Kip Twitchell: we've had.

572
01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:32.640
Kip Twitchell: People join our community, we have established an environment external to our development, environment, we have ways of putting out modules that are based upon the source code.

573
01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:42.030
Kip Twitchell: To those environments and can continue to work with that so it's not that we don't have built processes and build processes which are using this code.

574
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:57.990
Kip Twitchell: it's that the bill processes don't aren't necessarily automated fully for using this code at this point, and if that holds us back i'm okay with without holding us back if that's what they felt was was needed, but I think we're close enough that it, it makes sense for us to try.

575
01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:00.630
Ian: Our current process.

576
01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:01.470
Ian: Is all.

577
01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:04.920
Ian: built forge related and that's a proprietary system.

578
01:01:05.970 --> 01:01:06.240
Kip Twitchell: That.

579
01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:07.740
Ian: i've been all public builds.

580
01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:09.420
Randall Ness: that's.

581
01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:11.520
Kip Twitchell: that's right and and I would make that clear.

582
01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.740
Kip Twitchell: That it's not public, but we can deliver.

583
01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:17.970
Kip Twitchell: Public modules from from the team so that's my point.

584
01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:23.220
Ian: We were, I think we need to have some sort of.

585
01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:30.180
Ian: target documentation as well, so that time T zero where you make this thing.

586
01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:30.810
Randall Ness: available.

587
01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:35.100
Ian: To the general world, but the state of play is.

588
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.570
Ian: Clear.

589
01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:39.300
Ian: And what we want help on.

590
01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:48.540
Ian: Or what you're intending to do I fix the build process, one of the CIA things talks about continuous integration.

591
01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:55.260
Ian: We don't really do that and we don't have a mechanism to do it just yet.

592
01:01:56.490 --> 01:01:58.590
Ian: And I don't really understand how that.

593
01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:00.300
Randall Ness: works, you feed into.

594
01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:05.070
Ian: A Jenkins world or something so that whenever.

595
01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:10.110
Ian: Something changes it triggers an automatic build at the end of the day.

596
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:26.250
Ian: We used to have things like that in a previous company you was all held together like Keith Robinson thing with sticky tape and scripts and what have you but it's all hugely more organized nowadays.

597
01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:27.900
Kip Twitchell: well.

598
01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:36.900
Kip Twitchell: And on that to that point I just did a little video they put out on Geneva uris on polycephalum project, and I posted in the slack channel.

599
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:51.810
Kip Twitchell: from his that would be someplace in that I would look to see if there's some value in a moment that automation of that process it policy definitely would would provide us an open that space sure, but that's a longer term discussion.

600
01:02:52.710 --> 01:03:00.480
Ian: yeah there are still there still a massive amount of work to be done because we don't really have.

601
01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:15.870
Ian: A Java Ram on it, one, we have to rely on this, that the the c++ executable I think randall and I decided the other day that we would not actually release the c++ code.

602
01:03:17.850 --> 01:03:18.720
Ian: We.

603
01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:19.260
Ian: would just.

604
01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.790
rely on the executable.

605
01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.700
Ian: gotten our rationale now ramble.

606
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:24.240
But.

607
01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.170
Randall Ness: There were.

608
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:41.160
Randall Ness: Two and well, I think we had several reasons we said, certainly it's not what we want to have for the future, and we are in the process of rebuilding everything in Java so sometime in the next.

609
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:56.760
Randall Ness: few months we think there may be a Java Amor 91, and so we didn't want to confuse the issue by giving them the c++ number 91 two and then also there were things in the c++ program that we didn't feel like we wanted to go back and fix if we didn't need to.

610
01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:02.070
Ian: Yes, and it also yeah and it doesn't do.

611
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.390
Randall Ness: Some things that.

612
01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:04.260
Randall Ness: Maybe we'll.

613
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:08.700
Ian: wanted to yeah and it and it's also called buried in it.

614
01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:12.660
Ian: Some of the facilities, we.

615
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.530
Randall Ness: don't want.

616
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:14.220
Ian: Like.

617
01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:15.810
Ian: A hard copy and the.

618
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.100
Randall Ness: lot sort of stuff and.

619
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.660
Kip Twitchell: Let me add one more thing.

620
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:37.320
Randall Ness: kept kept before you before you get started, just one one last thing about here's The other reason, in that we wanted to delay doing that you said it would take you quite a bit to set up a build process externally, for us to get that working.

621
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:49.350
Randall Ness: Less and less and we said that your time is better spent, making the Java, Mr 91 work than trying to get the c++ or 91 to work external yes.

622
01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:49.980
Ian: that's true.

623
01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.070
Kip Twitchell: Okay, let me, let me ask this question.

624
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:53.430
Randall Ness: team.

625
01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:54.510
Randall Ness: I don't know.

626
01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:56.070
Randall Ness: I.

627
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:58.200
Kip Twitchell: There will be some.

628
01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:00.780
Kip Twitchell: level of.

629
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:02.490
Kip Twitchell: What.

630
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:05.160
Kip Twitchell: Of.

631
01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.580
Kip Twitchell: Attention that comes to us as we come.

632
01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.660
Kip Twitchell: become a full fledged.

633
01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:10.920
Kip Twitchell: Product project.

634
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.860
Randall Ness: I don't know how large that will be okay.

635
01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.660
Kip Twitchell: So, but there.

636
01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:32.700
Kip Twitchell: There will be some level of that so would we be better pushing out further becoming a full fledged project to April or something of that sort, or.

637
01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.400
Kip Twitchell: Should we.

638
01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:38.580
Kip Twitchell: Should we get feedback from the.

639
01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:39.960
Randall Ness: Technical advisory.

640
01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:45.180
Kip Twitchell: committee about what their expectations are, if you look briefly at the.

641
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:48.600
Randall Ness: At the.

642
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:50.310
Kip Twitchell: Online piece.

643
01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:52.260
Kip Twitchell: side the.

644
01:05:52.800 --> 01:06:05.610
Kip Twitchell: Number of full fledge projects is not very many see all the incubation projects well there's only is really the mentorship program and addy.

645
01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:12.540
Kip Twitchell: So this isn't a well trodden path for projects, you know MP.

646
01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.010
Kip Twitchell: would say.

647
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:34.290
Ian: has been run for sorry till seven has been around for quite a while now and it's much more mature than we are, we are taking off first steps, and if it was released as a hey look where we are in office steps coming joining us.

648
01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:35.490
Ian: mechanism and.

649
01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:36.180
Randall Ness: that's fine.

650
01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:49.170
GillianHannington: I think we should push it out, because I, I think the documentation is is pretty important, I think that.

651
01:06:50.370 --> 01:06:54.030
GillianHannington: If people are going to look at this it's very hard to understand like we need some.

652
01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:02.940
GillianHannington: I think we need to improve our documentation a bit more and and and what's made me think about this is so i'm reviewing the error messages at the minute and we're.

653
01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:08.940
GillianHannington: Trying to put them in all the error messages in a in a spreadsheet so we can create.

654
01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:10.650
Randall Ness: documentation from it and.

655
01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.330
Randall Ness: I just think it be better if we.

656
01:07:12.930 --> 01:07:14.490
GillianHannington: If we had something better in that.

657
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:15.930
Randall Ness: In that area to put out.

658
01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:17.700
Kip Twitchell: that's good seat.

659
01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.230
Kip Twitchell: Jillian other feelings.

660
01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:26.430
Randall Ness: Well, I guess it's just a clarification I guess the reason we were wanting to hit this deadline was so that we could.

661
01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:36.360
Randall Ness: piggyback on the 25th anniversary of the death of the mainframe thing and then gets more exposure that way is that the main reason we're trying to hit this deadline.

662
01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:38.370
Kip Twitchell: yeah that's.

663
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.840
Kip Twitchell: There was a bit there was a bit of.

664
01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:41.580
Kip Twitchell: ability to.

665
01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:43.740
Randall Ness: get some attention but.

666
01:07:44.490 --> 01:07:46.320
Kip Twitchell: To you know we don't want to.

667
01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:47.640
Randall Ness: disappoint either.

668
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.660
Right.

669
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.850
Kip Twitchell: Having someone able to do something as they become involved is.

670
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:56.460
Kip Twitchell: Important when you do these you don't.

671
01:07:57.030 --> 01:07:59.100
Kip Twitchell: You don't get multiple chances to get people to.

672
01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.300
Randall Ness: Come back to your website.

673
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:03.990
Kip Twitchell: If the first time it's not successful for them right.

674
01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:04.650
yeah.

675
01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:09.390
GillianHannington: Which is actually why I think.

676
01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:11.910
Randall Ness: Some good documentation is.

677
01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:13.530
GillianHannington: is valuable because if.

678
01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:18.090
GillianHannington: If people look at this and it's quite complex and don't know what to do and.

679
01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:23.130
GillianHannington: This is the snow like maybe use a guide or step by step, how to get started with this.

680
01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:25.560
Randall Ness: People are just not going to look at it.

681
01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:36.780
Randall Ness: i'm leaning towards delaying.

682
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.780
Randall Ness: Okay.

683
01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.090
Kip Twitchell: Andrea sandy.

684
01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.000
Randall Ness: Any feelings from you know Jeff.

685
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.740
Andrea Orth: i'm fine with the Lang but.

686
01:08:57.450 --> 01:08:58.920
Andrea Orth: i'd like to have it captured.

687
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.560
Andrea Orth: What the gaps are so.

688
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:04.590
Andrea Orth: Make sure to address them.

689
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.470
Sandy Peresie: I mean.

690
01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:17.250
Sandy Peresie: The the anniversary is after the tech meeting.

691
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:22.530
Randall Ness: So if you if you, you know.

692
01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:24.570
Randall Ness: You could suggest that the.

693
01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:30.450
Sandy Peresie: You became a projects, you know at the tech meeting directly after that.

694
01:09:31.530 --> 01:09:39.720
Sandy Peresie: You know, which would be April, so I do take your point about not wanting to disappoint I think if somebody comes out and tries to.

695
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:42.840
Sandy Peresie: get this information and use it.

696
01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:51.450
Sandy Peresie: If they don't have if it's very confusing they're not coming back, and so I think it's probably.

697
01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:52.620
Sandy Peresie: wise to.

698
01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:55.260
Sandy Peresie: push it off as well.

699
01:09:57.810 --> 01:09:58.320
Neil Beesley: My.

700
01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:01.410
Neil Beesley: My thoughts are.

701
01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.540
Randall Ness: The agreement with you that the.

702
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:11.520
Neil Beesley: People don't come back very easily if they look at something in it.

703
01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:22.440
Neil Beesley: They don't like like it first time they look at it, even though it looks 1000 times better next.

704
01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:24.270
Neil Beesley: Year.

705
01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:27.120
Randall Ness: I mean we.

706
01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:29.040
Neil Beesley: talked about build.

707
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:31.080
Randall Ness: But.

708
01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:33.420
Neil Beesley: Maybe even more than this is just a.

709
01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:34.200
Neil Beesley: Personal.

710
01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:35.160
Neil Beesley: Be in the corner.

711
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.040
Neil Beesley: Even more than build is to be.

712
01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:38.700
Neil Beesley: able to.

713
01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:49.830
Neil Beesley: download the executable files and a canned example of the data can and xml views and say.

714
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:51.840
Randall Ness: run this.

715
01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:53.340
Neil Beesley: And that's what's.

716
01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:53.910
Randall Ness: going to happen.

717
01:10:56.130 --> 01:10:57.240
Neil Beesley: Like a use case.

718
01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:58.920
Neil Beesley: I like very simple.

719
01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:05.430
Ian: If we have something an example thing on our bike on site that people could go to.

720
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:12.420
Ian: and generate things from the likes of Virginia data.

721
01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:14.190
Ian: That will be great.

722
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:17.700
Neil Beesley: But that's what they have to do, though, isn't it.

723
01:11:18.090 --> 01:11:19.770
Ian: Well, and not a can think.

724
01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:21.480
Neil Beesley: there's an example yeah yeah.

725
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:23.520
Ian: How to do something.

726
01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.180
Ian: Using that data or even our green sock database, but the.

727
01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:28.350
Ian: Green soft databases.

728
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:29.190
pretty poor.

729
01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:35.340
Kip Twitchell: So let me suggest in it good good discussion.

730
01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:43.230
Kip Twitchell: it's important for us do the work that we've the additional work we've outlined here right is not small amount of work.

731
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:48.930
Kip Twitchell: it's important for us to continue to push ourselves.

732
01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.660
Randall Ness: To try to get this get.

733
01:11:51.720 --> 01:12:04.500
Kip Twitchell: To the points that we're talking about here i'd like to propose then we're not talking about multi month delay that we're talking about one month delay and let's continue to focus ourselves, our focus is helpful.

734
01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:08.250
Kip Twitchell: To us, I think, in pushing ourselves to.

735
01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:10.110
Kip Twitchell: to accomplish what we're trying to.

736
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:12.000
Kip Twitchell: Do there's value.

737
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:12.780
In our.

738
01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:15.750
Kip Twitchell: In our there would be.

739
01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:22.890
Kip Twitchell: There would be bragging rights for us to be one of the fastest to get to project for omb.

740
01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:26.190
Kip Twitchell: We have enough capability.

741
01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:34.140
Kip Twitchell: We have a great enough team, we have a substantial set of things that we should be able to do that.

742
01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:40.830
Kip Twitchell: You know we're not Jerry edge and working by himself, we have a very good team.

743
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.150
So.

744
01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:43.710
Randall Ness: I.

745
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:45.900
Kip Twitchell: I propose that we continue to push.

746
01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.550
Randall Ness: This hard and look for.

747
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.310
Kip Twitchell: Seeing if we can do that the first of April.

748
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.930
Ian: One of the.

749
01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:57.630
Ian: One of the things I think we need and Andre and I talked about this is some.

750
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:09.690
Ian: way of getting visualization on the state of the project currently that some jira can ban board or or whatever.

751
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:10.860
Ian: Even a spreadsheet.

752
01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:11.550
would be good.

753
01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:16.380
Ian: randall I can hear chuckling chuckling in the background, even if he's on mute.

754
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:20.430
Ian: yeah, no, no.

755
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:23.730
Andrea Orth: master I had to get in get that in there.

756
01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:24.630
yeah I know.

757
01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:27.600
Ian: spreadsheets but.

758
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:31.650
Ian: We need something that if somebody turns up.

759
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:32.820
Randall Ness: and has a look.

760
01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:35.130
Ian: You can see, this is the state of the project.

761
01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:36.540
Ian: This is what they.

762
01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:37.710
Ian: are working on.

763
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:48.720
Ian: This is where they intend to do it by this is the, these are the chunks that need to be addressed and the chunks may well be improved.

764
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:51.060
Randall Ness: documentation get the.

765
01:13:51.480 --> 01:14:02.520
Ian: Continuous integration process working all the bits and pieces that all there, we need to be able to see for ourselves, not even externally.

766
01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:04.500
Randall Ness: and

767
01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:05.910
Ian: be able to see all those.

768
01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:13.440
Ian: Things and then somebody comes along and says, well, I can help with that because I know about that bit.

769
01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:16.080
Randall Ness: But, but that.

770
01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.870
Randall Ness: does not exist at the moment.

771
01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.820
Kip Twitchell: Now I think that's good, and then we.

772
01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:21.570
Randall Ness: can be.

773
01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.290
Kip Twitchell: More we can.

774
01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:25.080
Kip Twitchell: Increase in tighten up those pieces as well.

775
01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:25.740
Randall Ness: that's a good.

776
01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:28.290
Kip Twitchell: addition as well, so that the major areas i've.

777
01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:30.840
Kip Twitchell: noted here right is documentation.

778
01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:32.010
Kip Twitchell: Is a.

779
01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:35.430
Kip Twitchell: way of DEMO system of some sort that somebody.

780
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:36.720
Kip Twitchell: Can download and use.

781
01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:37.650
Kip Twitchell: Right.

782
01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:56.070
Kip Twitchell: We have to have code out there and ability to get to executable files and we need a better project status, for you know, and I was doing that already as part of our good first issues and tightening our issue management documentation those kinds of things.

783
01:14:57.090 --> 01:14:57.570
Kip Twitchell: So.

784
01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:04.860
Kip Twitchell: I think those are all good points, I appreciate the honesty and the energy we've got in the discussion here.

785
01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:17.790
Kip Twitchell: We have gone over we started late i'm loath to go too much longer unless there's some topic we do need to discuss and we haven't yet.

786
01:15:26.190 --> 01:15:30.510
Kip Twitchell: And maybe i'm sensing or ready to adjourn and get on with the work.

815
01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:52.860
planning.

816
01:17:55.020 --> 01:18:02.670
bobmcCormack: As I mentioned earlier that we've got a bash script for the p stuff and that bash script randall can also be run by.

817
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:06.900
bobmcCormack: bill forge so rather than a manual implementation it.

818
01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:08.160
bobmcCormack: could be pushed out by your.

819
01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:10.110
bobmcCormack: bill forge to automate.

820
01:18:10.710 --> 01:18:11.910

821
01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.460

Randall Ness: P i'm updating it.

823
01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:24.360
bobmcCormack: For the Apache to zero licenses to be complicated in the sense that we've got a drop the IBM stuff at the Apache get the right.

824
01:18:24.930 --> 01:18:40.080
bobmcCormack: Copyright year also it slightly different for macros and assemble and kobo and then we've got to do all the culling, as we saw yesterday with that peyton string slack know chains is ED trial well that was.

825
01:18:40.230 --> 01:18:41.100
bobmcCormack: previously done.

826
01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.900
bobmcCormack: No feedback on the party access for.

827
01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:46.350
Randall Ness: kip.

828
01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:48.000
bobmcCormack: For the SP 12 access.

829
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:54.210
bobmcCormack: Sorry freeze ssh tunnel issue, the party access is now working.

830
01:18:55.230 --> 01:19:00.690
bobmcCormack: So that's it for the infrastructure side of the House, do I have any questions, please.

831
01:19:06.930 --> 01:19:08.310
bobmcCormack: Good for me.

832
01:19:09.150 --> 01:19:10.470
Randall Ness: Questions you randall i'm.

833
01:19:10.650 --> 01:19:12.810
bobmcCormack: Given that way again to go another month.

834
01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:22.350
bobmcCormack: Do you want the a X mid form of the Mr naughty one module placed in the github.

835
01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:29.760
Well let's see.

836
01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:35.730
Randall Ness: That would be nice, I mean we've talked before about having executable forms of these sorts of things and.

837
01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:52.080
Randall Ness: You were saying, well, it didn't really belong in in github yeah i've been searching around it seems like there is some precedent for this I guess i'd like to figure out the right way to do this yeah i've heard about having like released repos in github and.

838
01:19:53.160 --> 01:20:00.840
Randall Ness: i'd like to find out what the standard is I don't wanna I don't want to do anything out of the ordinary but yeah I think I you know before.

839
01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:12.000
Randall Ness: I was thinking that the way to do this would be to have a Pax file because that's what soil was doing, but then occurred to me that it made sense for Zoe to have a pack file because they're all USS based.

840
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:18.780
Randall Ness: But we're not so I think it is appropriate to have an x empty file, instead, which would be more of a normal way to pass.

841
01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:30.840
Randall Ness: back and forth on the on the MPs side of the House, rather than USS side of the House so yeah I think that's the right technique, I just want to make sure that we put it in the right spot on github.

842
01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:38.910
Randall Ness: Okay, fair enough, they might let you ponder that but i've developed the process to produce and deliver.

843
01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:41.370
bobmcCormack: and await your decision, where, to put it.

844
01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:44.160
Okay.

845
01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:51.900
Randall Ness: i'd like i'd like to assign that to somebody else but I don't really quite know boom Oh well, i'll leave it leave it with me then.

846
01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:59.730
bobmcCormack: Right all to have a hunt around, and it must probably go in the p is a partially.

847
01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:00.900
bobmcCormack: A partial lamb.

848
01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:06.870
bobmcCormack: Release executable so i'll develop something get back to you, and if you're happy we'll do it.

849
01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:10.170
Randall Ness: sounds good good bye bye.

850
01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:16.290
bobmcCormack: Okay they've been no more questions the infrastructure.

851
01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:20.880
