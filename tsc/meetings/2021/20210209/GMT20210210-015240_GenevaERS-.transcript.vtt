Kip Twitchell: i'm not feeling real well random.

9
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.730
Kip Twitchell: But I was cold.

10
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.010
Kip Twitchell: I said well since i'm kind of cool.

11
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.380
Kip Twitchell: actually put on a jacket.

12
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.990
Sandy Peresie: Of course I did.

13
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:09.720
Kip Twitchell: Have.

14
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.340
Kip Twitchell: Somebody I was in.

15
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:11.460
Kip Twitchell: A.

16
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.630
Randall Ness: Business meeting.

17
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.980
Kip Twitchell: A couple weeks ago and they.

18
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.600
Kip Twitchell: The guy said hey.

19
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.330
Kip Twitchell: You know so we're actually going to all work collared shirts.

20
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:19.260
Kip Twitchell: For this.

21
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.300
Kip Twitchell: discussion and I put on this collared shirt I have this yellow.

22
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:32.340
Kip Twitchell: colored shirt button down, and I said later told me carry us it, you know what i've been saving that shirt for a year Colvin.

23
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:40.260
Kip Twitchell: I haven't matured I took it to the dry cleaners i'll never get back to the dry cleaners, can I spent my yellow shirt for this one meeting, three weeks ago.

24
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.220
Kip Twitchell: I was everybody told me, it was worth it.

25
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.460
Randall Ness: It was five good you know I don't know.

26
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.260
Kip Twitchell: we'll find out.

27
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.260
Kip Twitchell: How we doing today agree.

28
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.450
Kip Twitchell: majority of our.

29
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.070
Kip Twitchell: team here on today.

30
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.530
Ian: Jill is on her way.

31
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.000
Kip Twitchell: Okay.

32
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.790
Sandy Peresie: Do you know if neil's joining.

33
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.940
Sandy Peresie: don't see him on slack I.

34
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.760
Kip Twitchell: pinged him earlier today he knew yesterday.

35
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:27.690
yeah.

36
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.250
Kip Twitchell: slides on he's on slack.

37
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.490
Sandy Peresie: Oh yes, he is.

38
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.300
Sandy Peresie: He wasn't before.

39
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.150
Kip Twitchell: hopping in.

40
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.940
Kip Twitchell: So when I went to zoom Andrea I don't know if.

41
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.960
Kip Twitchell: We have to schedule these at some point.

42
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.790
Andrea Orth: Item from the last time you attended I forgot all about that.

43
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:22.470
Kip Twitchell: You know what i'm I think we're lucky that this meeting ID worked I don't know I don't know how the meeting ID get assigned, but I was in there and I was like no I don't see the meeting scheduled.

44
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.840
Sandy Peresie: me there's no meeting tonight.

45
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:28.860
well.

46
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.170
Kip Twitchell: run the meeting right now.

47
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:34.920
yeah.

48
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:41.400
Kip Twitchell: I just gave you a link oh there's Joe perry's meal Tony.

49
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.800
GillianHannington: hi sorry I was late.

50
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.360
Kip Twitchell: No good to have you.

51
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.160
No problem.

52
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:52.290
Kip Twitchell: Jim send his apologies you won't be joining us tonight.

53
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.740
Kip Twitchell: But we have, I think we have a quorum here.

54
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:00.660
Good.

55
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.780
Kip Twitchell: Should we briefly just kind of.

56
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.340
Kip Twitchell: go over the agenda, we did a little bit of planning last week.

57
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.180
Kip Twitchell: On the issues.

58
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:21.330
Kip Twitchell: And just kind of tagged next to the issues, if you want to go to the Community.

59
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.840
Kip Twitchell: repo issue site you'll see the.

60
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.990
Kip Twitchell: issues that are tagged as meeting.

61
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.370
Kip Twitchell: So you had a.

62
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:45.990
Kip Twitchell: kind of a project, update and a blog we've been asked to do i'll talk about that briefly, we wanted to talk about the mentorship and and ideas for for good first issue again.

63
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:53.670
Kip Twitchell: There is an issue on updating Wikipedia what we need to do around that way commit a responsibility just confirm.

64
00:12:54.900 --> 00:13:01.590
Kip Twitchell: What we're thinking about our competitors and how we're operating as an organization, make sure that we're all we're all clear on that.

65
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:09.960
Kip Twitchell: A little bit more about the website and wordpress and that reach into a little bit on.

66
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:15.330
Kip Twitchell: Maybe our plan is for next month and becoming a project.

67
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.100
Kip Twitchell: A little bit update on eyes nota.

68
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:29.700
Kip Twitchell: ggvc issue Oh, I think randall you said to close that one, and I think I still have it open, so I don't I mean that's because.

69
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.440
Kip Twitchell: And the Community guide and blog updates okay.

70
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:42.630
Kip Twitchell: So let me kind of give a brief update on things from my side we.

71
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.530
Kip Twitchell: had a meeting with john martek on Monday just kind of a status meeting.

72
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:56.550
Kip Twitchell: randall noted recently that that awesome Zoe team are the only ones that have.

73
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:03.810
Kip Twitchell: Perhaps have websites, besides the IMP website for our projects.

74
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:20.940
Kip Twitchell: The senses were you know from from john is he's very complimentary on the work we're doing as a project and, as a team yeah he appreciates the energy we have and then we're moving forward in a good way our influence.

75
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:30.570
Kip Twitchell: is broader than just the Geneva ERS project this Thursday on the technical advisory committee, the TAC.

76
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:43.110
Kip Twitchell: will be reviewing and approve the tech should be approving a project that we're we kind of started sponsoring and sandy and I are running.

77
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:51.870
Kip Twitchell: For the open the CEOs enablement project Oh, he is he the RD project.

78
00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.690
Kip Twitchell: it's about helping.

79
00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:12.750
Kip Twitchell: Helping with tools code and tools and approaches to providing greater access to CEOs environments based upon our own experience of challenges of of doing an open source development effort.

80
00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:19.320
Kip Twitchell: feedback on that has been very positive on the work group we started and.

81
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.860
Kip Twitchell: So there's some some good energy in that side of things as well we're running those periodically.

82
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:36.780
Andrea Orth: Yes, clarifying question when you use the word project does that mean a.

83
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.470
Andrea Orth: incubation project or just a working group still.

84
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:47.970
Kip Twitchell: that's a working group so good good point Andrew that my senses in all NP there's three kinds of levels there's a working group.

85
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:55.950
Kip Twitchell: Which isn't necessarily something that may even have code associated with it there's an incubation project and then there's a full fledged project.

86
00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:13.980
Kip Twitchell: And in and for the the work group the artsy working group it's right now will be approved as a working group, but we have leads on potentially to code contributions that I think may be something will trigger it to become a project.

87
00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.750
Kip Twitchell: On on an organization that.

88
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:27.390
Kip Twitchell: has some code that internally, they use to allow people to have access to zero s environments.

89
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.780
Kip Twitchell: Employees to request a zero s environment.

90
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:38.550
Kip Twitchell: And then there's also actually maybe i'll share your briefly have not.

91
00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.060
Kip Twitchell: I haven't explored this oh.

92
00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:48.420
Kip Twitchell: So host disabled sharing i'm probably not the host today, I might.

93
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.300
Andrea Orth: Nobody is the host today.

94
00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.060
Kip Twitchell: nobody's asked today so maybe we won't share.

95
00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.520
Andrea Orth: yeah yes we're not sharing that's really odd.

96
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.550
Kip Twitchell: I tried to log in as the host of the meeting wasn't on the schedule, so I can do that.

97
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.310
Kip Twitchell: um.

98
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:19.530
Kip Twitchell: So the there's a if you search actually aws CEOs there's a.

99
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.810
Kip Twitchell: blog entry from January 20 about.

100
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:31.800
Kip Twitchell: IBM Z the empty empty development and test environments available on.

101
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.960
Kip Twitchell: On aws.

102
00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:43.530
Kip Twitchell: So that may provide us another mechanism by which we could enable more access to cms environments.

103
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:53.130
Ian: By the way, you can claim to be the host there's a little button on the right hand side on the three dots and you can claim to be the host.

104
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.520
NeilBeesley: Even if you're an imposter.

105
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:02.670
Ian: Perhaps I haven't actually tried it it just says claim to be almost.

106
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.530
Ian: Almost.

107
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:24.390
Ian: underneath all the participants that says invite me and me, and then the three little dots click on the three little dots and you can claim host.

108
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.560
Kip Twitchell: me and I don't have those.

109
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:34.860
Kip Twitchell: Your.

110
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.980
Ian: leads the enter host key claim.

111
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.070
Ian: The six digit key or sign in to claim host.

112
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:56.430
Kip Twitchell: Well anyway i'll keep going if somebody can figure that out that'd be great.

113
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:17.940
Kip Twitchell: Okay, so maybe that's, I guess, maybe i'll go more to the more pertinent topic, rather than the secondary timing I john asked us, you asked me what we were thinking about becoming a full project right.

114
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:24.360
Kip Twitchell: And I said well john we kind of protectively thought about perhaps.

115
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:45.150
Kip Twitchell: Trying to go for that the attack meeting will be the second Thursday of of March for for applying them to be a full fledged project I said, you know I don't think we're we're there in terms of our code release.

116
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:58.080
Kip Twitchell: And you know we certainly can't say that we've done all of the things on the ci infrastructure badging thing that are required, according to the the badge requirements right.

117
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:14.070
Kip Twitchell: So you know I don't know if we we could get there, but it was kind of a goal we had set out a little bit to try to do so, I think, part of the discussion today, I wanted to have was about.

118
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.160
Kip Twitchell: about that and.

119
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:18.690
Kip Twitchell: man.

120
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:38.550
Kip Twitchell: What we think is possible, what we want to shoot for what are impediments to getting there I don't get the sense, and you know I don't have anyone that's given me a written assurance of any kind, I don't get the sense that there's a large audit that goes on relative to becoming a project.

121
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:49.830
Kip Twitchell: I suspect TAC members in the midst of the meeting would likely go to our repos and look at things in the repos and look at stuff there.

122
00:20:52.470 --> 00:21:03.300
Kip Twitchell: But I think that that would probably be the most inspection there'll be some questions, I suspect, to us, which we would answer honestly fairly in the meeting.

123
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:12.210
Kip Twitchell: But I think that that's more what the nature of this going for a project looks like I told, he said, Kim, what do you think your impediments are.

124
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:29.670
Kip Twitchell: doing all the things that are loud light in the sea, I imagine, I said john it's not that there's any we have any problems with working towards those things it's purely an issue of capacity and time to get there, he said Okay, I can understand that it's not it's not.

125
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.160
Kip Twitchell: Some fundamental disagreement about we shouldn't do those kinds of things, or that sort of thing.

126
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:41.430
Kip Twitchell: So let me pause there with that kind of introduction what's our feeling.

127
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.750
Kip Twitchell: About attempting to become a full fledged product project.

128
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:47.970
Kip Twitchell: And the timing for that.

129
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:58.140
bobmcCormack: Okay, my two cents worth is having looked through the CIO badge of the last couple of days.

130
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.690
bobmcCormack: Meeting it.

131
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:02.910
bobmcCormack: Is.

132
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:17.640
bobmcCormack: Straightforward except for one issue and that issue is gets around about the storage of passwords within the workbench, it would seem that we do not meet.

133
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:31.020
bobmcCormack: The requirements, we would have two things to do and that's and the technical issue about doing that is yet to be determined on how much you can do cost us an effort.

134
00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:40.620
bobmcCormack: We currently use Java six for storage of the password that we use to connect to the database now.

135
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:47.700
bobmcCormack: and correct me if i'm wrong do we still need passwords to correct a connect to the postgres.

136
00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.840
Ian: yeah yes, you do okay um.

137
00:22:53.700 --> 00:23:01.290
Ian: The normally it's locally well at the moment it's a local postgres database, but it could be anywhere.

138
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.770
Ian: On it is still bias in the same way.

139
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:14.430
bobmcCormack: Right, because the the Java X that you're using doesn't seem to i've been researching and I hadn't pinned it down exactly yet, but.

140
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:20.820
bobmcCormack: It may not proved to be a recognized or.

141
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:37.830
bobmcCormack: valid member of a process within the open source community and, of course, you would have to add password protection to the user ID that you currently obfuscate rather than you know I think back by six.

142
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:38.790
bobmcCormack: I believe we do.

143
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:45.690
Ian: I think yeah I don't know that we need to do it for that one because it's stored in the database.

144
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.830
Ian: it's it's kind of an independent password.

145
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.370
Ian: We I mean we could do for that as well.

146
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.650
Ian: and store as it's encrypted form.

147
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.740
Ian: yeah currently we use the D s algorithm.

148
00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:09.930
Ian: I don't know anything about how how it's blessed in the in the Open Source world.

149
00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:10.590
bobmcCormack: And yeah.

150
00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:17.670
Ian: I don't know how to change to something else i'm suspect we can we can do it relatively easily, though.

151
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.840
yeah.

152
00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:33.030
bobmcCormack: Well, I think we need to look at it further i'll keep researching the next day or so on whether the current job X with the dares selection is suitable.

153
00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:46.290
bobmcCormack: And if so, we could then use it for the other one, otherwise we may be forced into one of those other method methods that stated in the ci badge documentation.

154
00:24:47.430 --> 00:25:02.610
bobmcCormack: So that's where we are kip we're a little bit of a horns a dilemma one is is their current approach correct, we need for the database passwords and we will need to implement a new process to store the actual workbench user ID as well.

155
00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:09.570
Kip Twitchell: So thank you for that can I can I back up to the first comment you made as making that comment.

156
00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:28.530
Kip Twitchell: Just, just to clarify and make sure I I understand their your your comment was that the that the only major issue you see as around this password issue to comply with the CIA requirements, did I understand that correctly, is that is that.

157
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.240
Kip Twitchell: Yes, that's me now.

158
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:38.220
bobmcCormack: yeah in terms of gotchas the others are just a matter of simple matter of programming, so that when we do things in.

159
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:48.750
bobmcCormack: Get we follow the badge rules such as you know, we ensure that we do dynamic scanning we show we do static scanning.

160
00:25:49.110 --> 00:26:02.670
bobmcCormack: yada yada yada and semantic version and all that sort of stuff so that's this is mo piece, but the the gotcha at the moment is the password issue because we can't talk ourselves out of that, so we need to.

161
00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:04.590
bobmcCormack: come up with a solution.

162
00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:17.340
Kip Twitchell: Well okay so just reacting to that up that's great news right, I mean you know we're we're this where we're narrowing down the issues that far and that's that's very good to hear.

163
00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:27.660
Kip Twitchell: You know it's okay to have issues it's nice to have fewer issues and it's very nice to be working on those issues, so I appreciate.

164
00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.310
That.

165
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:40.860
Ian: The other thing I talked about with randall and I believe you mentioned to you was the process of getting the cold from.

166
00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:48.000
Ian: Behind the IBM firewall out into github currently there's a.

167
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:59.460
Ian: staging post in github slash IBM where john does whatever he john or his minions do whatever they do.

168
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.690
Ian: Yes, and then we move it to Geneva us.

169
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:13.890
Ian: My suggestion was just move it directly to God Geneva ERS but as a private repository to which we grant access.

170
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:24.510
Kip Twitchell: And I I am prayed I did not feel well today in and failed to follow up with john to find out if that would be okay, for us to do that.

171
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:42.000
Kip Twitchell: And I suggested you guys can suggest around all that when we asked john I could say john if there's and we don't want to leave bad history in a repo so if something went wrong and you did find something wrong in terms of the license we'd be okay deleting the repo and starting over.

172
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.640
Kip Twitchell: Because this would be our initial population of it anyway and see if he'd be okay with.

173
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.250
Kip Twitchell: Simplifying the process.

174
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.220
Kip Twitchell: Of that so.

175
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:56.730
Kip Twitchell: I think that that's.

176
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:13.380
Kip Twitchell: that's very good, we can ask that and that'd be great if we could I guess we're meeting again in two weeks, and we should make that a goal to have that done and accomplished, an issue out there by that point would be great I think.

177
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.720
Ian: I almost have three repositories ready to go.

178
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.480
Kip Twitchell: And i'll start so would that be to run control the workbench.

179
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:32.310
Ian: They is the workbench the test framework and i've called it, the Java front end, which is the.

180
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:40.080
Ian: it's got the flow analyze it in it and the code that will head towards being Mr 91.

181
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:41.250
Kip Twitchell: Okay yeah.

182
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:42.840
Kip Twitchell: I think we.

183
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:44.010
Ian: started that one yet.

184
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:49.650
Kip Twitchell: yeah we started calling that run control, if you want to call it something different, we could rename that was.

185
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.170
Kip Twitchell: that's sure yeah okay.

186
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:55.200
Sandy Peresie: So can I ask a question.

187
00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.090
Sandy Peresie: yeah um.

188
00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:05.670
Sandy Peresie: Does the password thing affect the running the execution the performance engine.

189
00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:08.820
Ian: No.

190
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:19.620
Sandy Peresie: Okay, so can we become a project by just having the performance engine out there for people to play with.

191
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.360
Sandy Peresie: Is that a stopgap goal.

192
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.520
Kip Twitchell: Sorry, I think I found a house code.

193
00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.950
Kip Twitchell: Andrea I just painted to you.

194
00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:58.410
Randall Ness: I guess so.

195
00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:05.880
Kip Twitchell: sandy if I took your question correctly it's about I mean, I guess, I related back to where we're at on the.

196
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.170
Kip Twitchell: On the infinity icon.

197
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:10.890
Kip Twitchell: machine.

198
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.880
Randall Ness: In terms of our.

199
00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.830
Kip Twitchell: usability of what we have there right.

200
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:14.310
Kip Twitchell: We have.

201
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.340
Kip Twitchell: We have a version there that's using.

202
00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:26.970
Kip Twitchell: postgres for the local database are you are you going to something different than that, and I think the issue here is not that the if I.

203
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:28.290
Kip Twitchell: stood Bob and.

204
00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.070
Kip Twitchell: And incorrectly.

205
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:40.680
Kip Twitchell: The issue is not so much that the code, we have is it doesn't work it's that it doesn't adhere to you know the best practices around password management.

206
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:54.780
Sandy Peresie: Is that correct correct yeah yeah I understand that, but you know if you're not using the password for the performance engine um you know people could technically.

207
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:56.970
Sandy Peresie: download.

208
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:00.510
Sandy Peresie: VP.

209
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:12.900
Sandy Peresie: and run a performance engine on their own machines yes um which might be a stage one stage two type of delivery release.

210
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:20.070
Sandy Peresie: Just a different way of looking at it, so we can become a full fledged project.

211
00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:27.900
Kip Twitchell: Well yeah so that's a so I see where you're going sandy you're suggesting this it go ahead yeah.

212
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:36.360
Ian: The test framework called that I have allows you to exercise the performance engine.

213
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.440
Ian: On a remote machine via ftp.

214
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:49.560
Ian: I haven't tested by pointing at Viacom yet, but it works when I pointed out an internal IBM.

215
00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.170
Ian: mainframe.

216
00:31:53.850 --> 00:32:05.100
Ian: It you need a password you need your password to login to the mainframe but it's not stored anywhere it's just used you enter it asks you for the password and uses it as part of the ftp.

217
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.490
Ian: So there's no storage and that we could.

218
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.710
Ian: bless to get that blessed and put that out into the world.

219
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:22.020
Ian: may be aware, to get something out there that we could say we had some code there.

220
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:24.960
Kip Twitchell: Okay.

221
00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:31.260
Kip Twitchell: So, I guess, maybe i'll put this up a little bit for discussion in a vote here.

222
00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:38.070
Kip Twitchell: Do we want to try to target the second Thursday of March to.

223
00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:42.240
Kip Twitchell: see if we can become a full fledged project any.

224
00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:47.820
Kip Twitchell: Any hesitancy about charging to that trying to trying to make that happen.

225
00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:57.930
Randall Ness: And to achieve that, we have to satisfy what we have to have how much source code out there.

226
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.990
Kip Twitchell: So it would be good if we had.

227
00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.660
Kip Twitchell: The three repositories that ends talking about.

228
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.090
Kip Twitchell: Where would we be good.

229
00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:15.000
Kip Twitchell: Good question randall Where would we be on the performance engine God what's the status on that.

230
00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.880
Randall Ness: Well let's see so.

231
00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:26.460
Randall Ness: Bob were you looking at changing these copyright notices to include the Apache license in the performance engine code.

232
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.700
bobmcCormack: Yes, that's still to do on my part.

233
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.070
bobmcCormack: i'm still playing around with that.

234
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.700
bobmcCormack: In parallel.

235
00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:34.950
bobmcCormack: The other thing, of course, is.

236
00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.470
Randall Ness: At what point can we divorce.

237
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.050
bobmcCormack: The P into two portions.

238
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.300
bobmcCormack: IBM and IBM.

239
00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:45.600
Kip Twitchell: For the.

240
00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:48.510
Kip Twitchell: For the zip enablement pieces right.

241
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.570
bobmcCormack: plus some memory stuff I think.

242
00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:54.900
NeilBeesley: SIP stuffs done isn't it.

243
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:08.730
GillianHannington: Sorry lazy noisy here in a minute and yeah the zip stuff has been delivered so that's been separated out and.

244
00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.830
Randall Ness: How we manage the.

245
00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:13.320
GillianHannington: bills i'm still not really clear on that.

246
00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:14.820
and

247
00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:21.420
GillianHannington: we've also got to make sure that being db db to stuff separated that as well.

248
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.050
GillianHannington: as well, I think all it is.

249
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:42.870
Randall Ness: I think all of this is just a matter of having a build process that just doesn't include that six module and doesn't include the db to via V San module and then I think I think that's all you really need to have to say that we're a Geneva urs performance engine.

250
00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:45.660
Randall Ness: Okay.

251
00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:50.400
GillianHannington: As far as i'm concerned that that codes, the coatings done it's um.

252
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:53.430
GillianHannington: it's just a matter of place, I just to build.

253
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.640
Randall Ness: well.

254
00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:59.460
bobmcCormack: In that case, randall what we can do is, we can.

255
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:05.250
bobmcCormack: I can move the performance engine from our to see into.

256
00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.020
bobmcCormack: The IBM github.

257
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.930
bobmcCormack: By for the assembler and the.

258
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:12.000
bobmcCormack: end the macros and copy parts.

259
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:13.290
bobmcCormack: We don't worry about the.

260
00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:14.700
bobmcCormack: c plus plus.

261
00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.130
bobmcCormack: And then we could do a.

262
00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:27.450
bobmcCormack: Very simple build process of doing a get clone populating exhaust libraries and running assemblies.

263
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:37.140
bobmcCormack: And of course in in parallel update the Apache license as well.

264
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.150
bobmcCormack: So.

265
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:48.180
bobmcCormack: One of them if you're happy, I can make a start on that and we can report back in there fortnight call the next one in fortnight.

266
00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.770
Kip Twitchell: I think that'd be an excellent car wow I like that let's.

267
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:53.130
Listen.

268
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:54.780
Kip Twitchell: and

269
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.810
Ian: i'm also wondering whether we should.

270
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:07.290
Ian: An initial thing release the c++ Code as a as a throwaway thing we're not going to develop it at all.

271
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:11.460
Kip Twitchell: No, I think that's interesting idea yeah and I thought that for a long time.

272
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:14.460
Kip Twitchell: that the old the old c++ version right.

273
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:16.230
Randall Ness: yeah the place on.

274
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:17.520
Randall Ness: It.

275
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:29.370
Ian: Well it's because it's the only front end you've got the only am I 91 you have until, but you can I don't know how it's done what you can put it there in we can make it buildable.

276
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:46.080
Ian: But you you freeze it we're not going to do any more development on it, it is what it is and we're going to replace it with a Java version, but it will allow someone to do the job, the problem.

277
00:36:47.100 --> 00:37:01.680
Ian: You have to you can only do it through workbench xml because it doesn't talk to postgres, but it still has a path if if we can generate workbench xml out of the postgres database, but that will be the only path for you how.

278
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:09.990
bobmcCormack: What about licensing within the c++ code do we have any gotchas there you think a.

279
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.350
Ian: Good question.

280
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:16.530
Ian: I can't.

281
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.900
Randall Ness: Think of any off the top my head.

282
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.420
Ian: Okay, so I tried, I took out.

283
00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:25.620
Ian: All the third party things that were floating around.

284
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.780
bobmcCormack: that's in the vc mainline.

285
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:47.430
Ian: yeah and yeah and it does make an odd vc connection, but I don't think that's a problem it's not the jd vc connection, but we have in fact yeah we just disable about we wouldn't do that the Open Source anyway.

286
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:53.220
Ian: Just make it run purely and simply off with bench xml.

287
00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:00.600
Kip Twitchell: yeah it brings up a point, but we should probably update the.

288
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:10.470
Kip Twitchell: Third party license agreement under the Community document because we still have db to database for CEOs listed there and we've made changes to them so.

289
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:14.550
bobmcCormack: So that was the licenses in the Community.

290
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.040
bobmcCormack: You have dropped, maybe two okay.

291
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:27.990
Kip Twitchell: Well Okay, I, like the energy, I, like the discussion, it seems very good to me.

292
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:31.620
Andrea Orth: Okay.

293
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:42.030
Andrea Orth: Yes, I don't want to that goal, you got to have some sort of write up like announcement, for I don't know oh MPs page or something.

294
00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:48.210
Kip Twitchell: yeah well good Andrea you're going on to the next agenda item which you know is assigned to you actually.

295
00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.740
Randall Ness: we've been asked to do a blog.

296
00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.580
Kip Twitchell: update for.

297
00:38:56.670 --> 00:39:01.620
Kip Twitchell: posting on the oh NP by the end of the month and.

298
00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:19.080
Kip Twitchell: So there's a little bit here and and you know I have been pretty vocal about the date of March 15 next month in the 25th anniversary of when the Stewart alsop said, the last mainframe was going to be turned off he predicted that in 1993 saying.

299
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:27.540
Kip Twitchell: march 15 1996 will be the day the last mainframe has turned off well next month is 25 years to the day.

300
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:42.420
Kip Twitchell: So john martek said hey can you know we'll be doing a spring news release around that you've generated some energy around that and if you go and become a project we didn't include you as part of that.

301
00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:48.360
Kip Twitchell: So I agree, I think you know my sense here we've got enough energy.

302
00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.110
Kip Twitchell: We haven't figured all the issues out but.

303
00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:09.900
Kip Twitchell: It would be good for us to kind of start drafting that blog entry with the idea that we want to be announcing you know that we're becoming a full fledged project and just just make this a big deal for the project, you know public announcement in that sense.

304
00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.290
Okay.

305
00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:23.070
Kip Twitchell: So let's give it a shot.

306
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.400
Sandy Peresie: Are there specific topics, you want to talk about.

307
00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:42.900
Kip Twitchell: Well, so may gave me if you look at the issue project update blog do it's issue number 92 may gave specific kind of what she was looking for.

308
00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:47.580
Kip Twitchell: Where the projects going in 2021.

309
00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:53.100
Kip Twitchell: Quick overview of the project few milestones for this year summary of how to get involved.

310
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.870
Kip Twitchell: So.

311
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:09.900
Kip Twitchell: let's kind of go there, a little bit more.

312
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:21.930
Kip Twitchell: Just so one thing that you guys know john mentioned that the Linux Foundation has a process where they they create.

313
00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:32.250
Kip Twitchell: llc limited liability corporations to be legal entities to hold the intellectual property for projects.

314
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.810
Kip Twitchell: What it means is it doesn't change how we operate at all as a project.

315
00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:45.060
Kip Twitchell: All it means is that the Linux Foundation has established.

316
00:41:46.080 --> 00:42:01.350
Kip Twitchell: A limited liability corporation, and all of the assets of Geneva ERS, including the domain name and our code and and our website all of that stuff would be listed as owned by the limited liability Corporation.

317
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:15.000
Kip Twitchell: The the purpose, for that is that it it helps protect the open source community that if somebody were to try to go use the Code against our Apache to point a license.

318
00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:25.140
Kip Twitchell: That there's a there's a legal entity that has standing with which to go Sue to go get enforcement about hey.

319
00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:34.860
Kip Twitchell: You know you're not complying with with the ownership of this this code and what the license looks like is unlikely that happens.

320
00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:44.280
Kip Twitchell: um but you know it, the process, they have to create these things is fairly low cost for them they've set this up fairly well.

321
00:42:45.120 --> 00:43:02.670
Kip Twitchell: So um there's he was asking us about our feelings about that my sense is that it would be a good thing to do, I don't think that there's any downside to doing that, but let me throw that out there, see if there's any questions or feelings about that in the Community here.

322
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.950
Ian: As far as I understand the Apache to license is pretty.

323
00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:09.900
Ian: pretty much.

324
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:18.510
Ian: Take it as it is on you do whatever you like, with it that's that's my non legally summary of it.

325
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:33.360
Kip Twitchell: Well, you do have to you do have to pass on the license in, and you have to be clear about where the materials came from that you took from the license so there's some transparency involved in the lights.

326
00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:34.590
Ian: Okay yeah.

327
00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:36.030
Ian: Okay, I see yep.

328
00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.760
Ian: As I complete the side.

329
00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:42.420
Ian: Can I give a shout out to van Carter who has joined the meeting hi Ben.

330
00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:46.500
Kip Twitchell: Oh Hello van cat, thank you for joining Gaddafi here.

331
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:48.300
VenkateswaraKaikala: yep hi everyone.

332
00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.400
Kip Twitchell: Any any other feelings on that legal entity point just.

333
00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:02.670
Kip Twitchell: Because I think probably becoming a project would be a good point for us to get that done.

334
00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:08.460
Randall Ness: Okay.

335
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:13.230
Randall Ness: sounds good to me Okay, thank you.

336
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:21.090
NeilBeesley: llc that's owned by the Linux foundation.

337
00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:23.010
Kip Twitchell: Yes, right.

338
00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.010
Kip Twitchell: They would be the owners of it.

339
00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:29.190
NeilBeesley: So that makes it totally safe.

340
00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:36.570
NeilBeesley: Yes, for any corporation to come and use it as an open source product.

341
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:37.560
Yes.

342
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:44.970
Kip Twitchell: It gives them a very neutral and and guaranteed way of knowing that it's open source.

343
00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:54.300
Kip Twitchell: there's a lot of there's a lot of liability that gets reduced for companies by participating in that sort of thing because it's not.

344
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:59.850
NeilBeesley: Because people like Morgan Stanley look at stuff like that yep.

345
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:05.580
Kip Twitchell: Because lawsuits around intellectual property can be very expensive yeah.

346
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:26.100
Kip Twitchell: Okay let's go to just a minute here on the we want to have a little bit of discussion about our website right now we're using wordpress as the hosting editing tool for our website.

347
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:38.730
Kip Twitchell: there's been a suggestion that we might think about more open source approaches to our website development and and such and I know.

348
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:50.850
Kip Twitchell: Andrea and sandy you've had a few thoughts on this if there's others that have joined in what, what are we thinking about migrating her website what we would go to in that space.

349
00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.670
Andrea Orth: So it's kind of a.

350
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:13.800
Andrea Orth: Two pronged discussion I think most of the discussion was around our consumer documentation, or whoever wants to use Geneva areas of using a more open source solution.

351
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:22.890
Andrea Orth: there's various tools out there, such as you go and jackal I know there's more but NK docs.

352
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:28.290
Andrea Orth: That they use get to hold the static content.

353
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.950
Andrea Orth: Yes, and then you can use your pipelines, etc.

354
00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:42.000
Andrea Orth: With these other tools such as you go and it generates the basically the presentation layer and there's.

355
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:50.640
Andrea Orth: No with you go they have it's also open source of some sort and people contribute.

356
00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:59.190
Andrea Orth: Things for similar to wordpress themes, for you know look and feel.

357
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:02.670
Andrea Orth: of how the website is.

358
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:09.690
Andrea Orth: When it comes to completely replacing Jenny brs I haven't looked too hard at that.

359
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:19.170
Andrea Orth: Because it might have some different requirements and i'd have to look at some things.

360
00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:19.650
yep.

361
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:23.730
Ian: i've been doing some work on this very topic.

362
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.450
Ian: bundle tell you.

363
00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:29.850
Ian: there's a tool called gatsby.

364
00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:37.860
Ian: Which is a javascript no jess way of doing it it's exactly the same kind of thing, as you go.

365
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:49.260
Ian: it's got some wonderful themes that have been looking at them i've been getting eugene involved, given that he's our technical writer person.

366
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:53.040
Ian: he's been having look as well.

367
00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:59.250
Ian: And this is not a replace would not be a replacement for the wordpress sites.

368
00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.520
Ian: It would be a.

369
00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:14.160
Ian: an adjunct if you look at how we do this, they have a site called zombie.org, but they also have a zombie Doc site.

370
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:22.740
Ian: Yes, and no we Doc site is run through they are currently running through a thing called view press the UV press.

371
00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:29.580
Ian: When I was chatting to one of their developers and they're finding that quite limited.

372
00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.290
Ian: In fact, I talked to this girl in Shanghai.

373
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:43.290
Ian: and explained what I was looking at and she was quite interested when I was looking at and then tried to recruit me to come and join the zoho projects.

374
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:45.780
Ian: and

375
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:50.040
Ian: But i've been looking at this Godspeed looks really good.

376
00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:56.370
Ian: And, as I said, to eugene the key that we got to choose, something that.

377
00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:11.070
Ian: The tool does not hinder us, we can concentrate on what we want in the content, so the likes of eugene can use it and create the documentation that we want to create without being bogged down by the tool.

378
00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.960
Ian: And from what I can see back gatsby is it will do that.

379
00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:36.870
Ian: And there are some links, I have four sites that I can I can email us all some bits and pieces or eugene kind about the things that we've been looking at some of them look really nice, one of the problems that the zombie the if you've seen this already dark sides.

380
00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:38.670
Ian: there.

381
00:49:39.990 --> 00:50:00.300
Ian: They don't like the the being constrained to the two column view the the thing about one of the views, one of the themes i've just been looking at is it's a three column thing so it's a bit like gretel website and it's a bit like the agile website, you get.

382
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:09.600
Ian: kind of an index on the left, what you're really readings on the right and on the right hand side you get a kind of an internal content page.

383
00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:12.810
Ian: An internal content list.

384
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:18.810
Ian: At the top you've got the bonds of jump howdy jump around.

385
00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:21.390
Ian: it's kind of cool.

386
00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:29.670
Kip Twitchell: And just so i'm clear this is more around it kind of how I viewed it a little bit this.

387
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:37.410
Kip Twitchell: I think there's value in having our website be just a bit more dynamic.

388
00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:47.310
Kip Twitchell: Certainly there's an overlap in what you do for the website and what you do for the documentation in the to have to have an intersection at a point right.

389
00:50:49.080 --> 00:51:09.090
Kip Twitchell: But a lot of the ones i've done the website sort of work on on the wordpress site right it's there's value in in being able to kind of make changes pretty quickly on a website relative to something happens on the project get something out there fairly quickly.

390
00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:19.590
Kip Twitchell: about what it does and and the history and and so it's it's a bit more public relations oriented, as opposed to.

391
00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:22.680
Kip Twitchell: To the documentation sort of work.

392
00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:26.520
Kip Twitchell: Is that that's your sense to you came in.

393
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:32.400
Ian: yeah yeah these guys, besides the run through github.

394
00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:34.710
Ian: You basically.

395
00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:43.140
Ian: Credit branch change whatever you want to change commit the branch publish it and you're done.

396
00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:47.040
Ian: It will be there out on the website.

397
00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:58.020
Kip Twitchell: I mean if we shouldn't do some experimentation Andrew.

398
00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:00.450
Andrea Orth: well.

399
00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.720
Andrea Orth: One question I have is.

400
00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.900
Andrea Orth: For this March 13 bowl.

401
00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:21.150
Andrea Orth: Because I think we should have some changes made i've been looking at that site look in the back requirements and thinking about the date, and I think some things on the site, need to be more clear yep you know, so if we get more traffic.

402
00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:28.380
Andrea Orth: They can have a better idea of what we're doing, and all that good stuff.

403
00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:41.280
Andrea Orth: So the question is, do we want to do we have time to experiment and have something by the march 13 day or do we leave as is for now.

404
00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:51.210
Kip Twitchell: No, I think it's good Andrea I know you say that question answered comes to me fairly clearly it's okay to experiment, but let's not make it a deadline of March 13 right.

405
00:52:51.930 --> 00:53:02.940
Kip Twitchell: We could I don't think conversion is something important for the March 13 date of the website really right in terms of going to a better tooling.

406
00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:08.460
Kip Twitchell: I should look here real briefly at.

407
00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:10.260
Kip Twitchell: The.

408
00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:25.020
Kip Twitchell: Look at the the due date for the wordpress site it's an it's an $84 charge for a year, so, even if we paid another $84 for the next year.

409
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.460
Kip Twitchell: that's probably not a big deal.

410
00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:37.230
Kip Twitchell: If we needed to go there, I mean, let me check the date on that renewal of that that.

411
00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:43.740
Sandy Peresie: So the different options that we're talking about our Hugo gets being then maybe get pages.

412
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.170
Ian: pages is really jackal.

413
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:51.210
Sandy Peresie: Oh, is it okay.

414
00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:54.840
Sandy Peresie: It is you go gets being jackal yeah.

415
00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:03.090
Ian: And if you wanted to think about the design docs that view press, but I would just rolled out without.

416
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:07.740
Sandy Peresie: Saying if they're if they're finding problems already you know.

417
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:14.490
Ian: yeah yeah the differences in terms of programming language just get pages kind of automated but.

418
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.450
Ian: You don't you have less control over what you get.

419
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:26.520
Ian: In you can create your own checklist sites hugo's written in go it's the language go, hence the Hugo.

420
00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:34.890
Ian: got to be is javascript so it's a lot like javascript on how to do that one.

421
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:37.680
Ian: and

422
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:41.550
Ian: What was the third one.

423
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:43.020
Sandy Peresie: It was jackal.

424
00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:46.080
Ian: jackal jackal was written in Ruby Ruby.

425
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:48.960
Ian: Which i'm not quite sure about.

426
00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:55.140
Sandy Peresie: I think I read something that Ruby was on the downswing.

427
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:59.700
Ian: yeah it is what javascript is kind of.

428
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:02.760
Ian: The latest hot thing.

429
00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:07.530
Ian: I was going to try and post some links through this chat thing.

430
00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:11.670
Ian: And I sent them to eugene there.

431
00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:16.080
Ian: A little while ago.

432
00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:25.380
Kip Twitchell: While you're doing that in so Andrea are our website was I registered domain name on April 14.

433
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:35.130
Kip Twitchell: So we have to, we have an $18 charge and an $84 or pardon me $42 41 year.

434
00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:38.250
Kip Twitchell: charged coming up on April 14.

435
00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:44.700
Kip Twitchell: that's for Geneva year s.com and Geneva year s.wordpress.com.

436
00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:51.180
Kip Twitchell: Then in June 17 I registered junior year s.org.

437
00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:52.350
Andrea Orth: Okay.

438
00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.870
Kip Twitchell: that's an $18 charge so.

439
00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:09.390
Kip Twitchell: Now those charges, we may be able to turn those over to to the Linux foundation anyway, you know as part of this so that may not be a big deal but that's kind of a dates for when things turn over on us.

440
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:17.730
Ian: there's a link posted there, of a kind of the kind of thing I was aiming for.

441
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:24.930
Ian: Obviously the you can change the colors the funds all the rest of it all.

442
00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:27.690
Ian: Flexible.

443
00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:35.040
Kip Twitchell: yeah this looks very much like the layout that's used in spark documentation.

444
00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:43.740
Ian: yeah it's it's nice nice thing on the left the men, but in the middle and there's a contents in into sub contents thing on the right.

445
00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:55.650
Ian: And you can put whatever you like on top, and then you have and generally, you have a landing page on top of it all with different sections.

446
00:56:59.190 --> 00:57:01.830
Sandy Peresie: And it's this one i'm sorry.

447
00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:04.530
Ian: This would be through god's be this one.

448
00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:04.890
Yes.

449
00:57:08.070 --> 00:57:10.980
Ian: that's one of one of the guts be example ones, I believe.

450
00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:29.700
Ian: The the key the it's what you, am what i'm trying to look for is what the Info is that style and then there are some clouds there that are free, you just I can you got to create another repository to hold all the stuff.

451
00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:33.720
Ian: You created guts be repository.

452
00:57:35.970 --> 00:57:41.880
Ian: And then you start it i've been doing it in i'm looking at some of the stuff in the evenings.

453
00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:56.250
Ian: In in a few days time, you might have an example gatsby thing that I can show you what it's working out of my personal github account.

454
00:57:57.510 --> 00:58:05.910
Ian: I won't put any direct Geneva us something anything in there she'll just say here is an example kind of gatsby website.

455
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:08.760
Ian: We can use it out of there.

456
00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:14.340
Sandy Peresie: So I said there's a guest be repository it's not a github repository.

457
00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:19.920
Ian: know your kid you create a github repository with got the source code in there.

458
00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:26.910
Sandy Peresie: Okay fancy source code Okay, well, we already have a documentation repository this is kind of stuff we put it there right.

459
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:34.080
Ian: Now that's it well sort of it, but it says, it would be a different a different one.

460
00:58:36.330 --> 00:58:36.540
Ian: yeah.

461
00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:50.490
Sandy Peresie: That was one of the things we were supposed to we're supposed to go over is what's in each repository with a little bit more details i'm from last week, two weeks ago.

462
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.560
Ian: So.

463
00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:54.030
Sandy Peresie: So.

464
00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.160
Sandy Peresie: I think we need to.

465
00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:08.490
Ian: think the way that it kind of works or a way that it would kind of work is that each of repositories would also have a parallel documentation repository.

466
00:59:11.790 --> 00:59:19.530
Ian: Or you could try and put them all in one place it's probably more flexible, to have a Doc suppository for each one that you want to document.

467
00:59:24.810 --> 00:59:27.570
Ian: If you're looking Zoe they've got laws repositories.

468
00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:29.880
Ian: But.

469
00:59:31.530 --> 00:59:36.330
Ian: You can choose to put them all in one, but you step on each other's toes maybe I don't know.

470
00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:43.680
Ian: So documenting the actual assembler performance engine thing and how to run it.

471
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:51.930
Ian: could be done separately to to the test framework repository the documentation.

472
00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:57.120
Kip Twitchell: Let me.

473
00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:07.440
Kip Twitchell: Let me, let me just pre miss you have for just a second here sandy to your point, this is under if you go under, Geneva ERS and teams.

474
01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:21.510
Kip Twitchell: This is one of the points that we wanted to kind of clarify these are the the we have been given full authority Finally on on we've proven ourselves worthy of having control of our repos and such.

475
01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:28.440
Kip Twitchell: So the way the the Open Source communities work under.

476
01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:36.870
Kip Twitchell: Linux foundation is that a competitor's form a committee that that if there was something that needed to be voted on and.

477
01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:48.120
Kip Twitchell: It doesn't often happen, you know, we were very collaborative group so you know we're not tremendously formal, but if there was something where there was some disagreement among us.

478
01:00:49.020 --> 01:01:02.340
Kip Twitchell: that the people, the way form of decisions are made is that the competitors for our project form a committee that vote for any of the proposals or are any of.

479
01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:09.780
Kip Twitchell: The ways that we need to go so right now, just so you're aware, this is the.

480
01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:17.760
Kip Twitchell: The set of competitors, which in a sense would probably be tied to the different repos.

481
01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:35.130
Kip Twitchell: Community of competitors documentation repo gv be live, which was kind of our utility library that we were working with performance engine think that this was running control for him or 91 resources was intended to be like.

482
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:42.540
Kip Twitchell: sample J cl and script generators.

483
01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:46.860
Kip Twitchell: spark PLC and the workbench.

484
01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:48.570
Okay.

485
01:01:56.010 --> 01:02:05.280
Kip Twitchell: I don't know that there's much more that needs to be said about that we're kind of running short a little bit on time, but I did want to cover that off real briefly any questions comments on that.

486
01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.190
NeilBeesley: The example data with okay.

487
01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:16.530
NeilBeesley: Does that have to be gone, where does that have to be got for all.

488
01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:33.990
Kip Twitchell: Well, right now, the example data sits under there's limits on on github for file sizes, I had attempted to put the the we could put a cut down version if we wanted to under perhaps resources.

489
01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:44.340
Kip Twitchell: The full Virginia data for volume testing github does not allow those sizes of files right so.

490
01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:45.840
Kip Twitchell: The data today.

491
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:54.030
Kip Twitchell: sits in something called data warrant is a free place that I found that allowed me to upload the full set of data.

492
01:02:55.260 --> 01:03:03.090
NeilBeesley: But we could have a cut down version and a set of the DPS and JC oh what goes.

493
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:11.490
Kip Twitchell: Well, yes, so and I I would view that as being something that went under resources kind of a utility space for something.

494
01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:18.120
Ian: that we need to have the data itself, or do we just have a link to the actual data.

495
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:26.610
Kip Twitchell: I think that we're doing a number of work and i'll let you comment here, Neil sandy we're we're doing some work on getting the data in a better form.

496
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:43.020
Kip Twitchell: and southern raw data that's sitting in the data world it may be useful for us to have a very small event file that allows testing out of an environment very quickly kind of a factor in my mind.

497
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:44.280
sure.

498
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:48.690
Ian: I would have thought perhaps the best thing to do was to refer to the.

499
01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:52.860
Ian: Third party data and then have a.

500
01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:01.440
Ian: How do you monetize it projects and that's what you run first and then you don't need to store the data at all.

501
01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:04.020
Kip Twitchell: could do that.

502
01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:13.290
NeilBeesley: How much work is that, though, when in the data preparation, shall I call it.

503
01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.680
I mean that's been.

504
01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:20.760
NeilBeesley: Some programming going on Sunday.

505
01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:23.100
Sandy Peresie: yeah.

506
01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:26.340
Sandy Peresie: Can you hear me.

507
01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:27.630
Kip Twitchell: Yes, we can hear you okay.

508
01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:28.530
um.

509
01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:39.420
Sandy Peresie: there's the original data was out there and csv format, some of it is is fixed format some of its not in data world.

510
01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:49.890
Sandy Peresie: Right that's not at all what the Virginia data is Virginia data is all comedy limited, and you know, so the data has been massaged quite a bit.

511
01:04:50.700 --> 01:05:07.320
Sandy Peresie: Alright, and we are doing additional massaging on Viacom so um you know if we're going to put you know sample data out there, we probably want to take these files off of icon and stick them in the resource repository.

512
01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.690
Kip Twitchell: Of that is it just to.

513
01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:17.370
Kip Twitchell: Just to echo what you're saying that part of the issues is that it's common to limited file it's not very mainframe friendly no.

514
01:05:17.790 --> 01:05:34.800
Kip Twitchell: So we're having to do a bunch of work to get it into something that would be more typical of a mainframe data environment dan's point we could do this more of a systematic development of maintaining each one of the steps and and being able to repeat those steps to do that.

515
01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:37.560
Kip Twitchell: I don't know.

516
01:05:38.010 --> 01:05:40.620
Sandy Peresie: They would be a really, really cool.

517
01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:42.660
Sandy Peresie: On p.

518
01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:51.600
Sandy Peresie: What is it that the thing that we're trying to one of the.

519
01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.960
Kip Twitchell: Z ozzy project.

520
01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:59.550
Sandy Peresie: No, no, no, no i'm the the people that mentor.

521
01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:00.720
Ian: channel danger.

522
01:06:01.650 --> 01:06:15.210
Ian: yeah it's it's an it will be kind of an adjunct process project to to to Geneva ERS of how do you massage your data to be digestible.

523
01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:22.650
Kip Twitchell: You know that's an interesting point that's come up here sandy you're right that's a fairly useful mentoring project isn't it.

524
01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.150
Sandy Peresie: yeah it is.

525
01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:40.140
Sandy Peresie: It is you can you know I mean they can go out and get the Virginia data, and you know I think we have to think about that that that actually would be a good thing I don't know if it's too late, because I never got a response back, but you know I take your point.

526
01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:54.180
Sandy Peresie: And that they know it's a really it's probably a really good idea to be able to go out and not store the data anywhere just have a process like you said that says go out to this website and.

527
01:06:54.720 --> 01:07:05.760
Sandy Peresie: pick up some data now, having said that there is some issue with some of the roles, I think kip you found some of that so it had it had to be a fairly.

528
01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:14.310
Sandy Peresie: You don't want to think blowing up because they're going to think it's it's Geneva your us enough, the data, so you have to make sure the data is it does not have any.

529
01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:22.440
Sandy Peresie: issues in it, which is, I don't believe is the case and and the format changes, based on the year so.

530
01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:30.630
Sandy Peresie: I think um I think it's a good idea to have that um you know I just think it's a.

531
01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.080
Sandy Peresie: bit to bite off right now.

532
01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:37.290
Sandy Peresie: Unless somebody to do it.

533
01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:46.890
Kip Twitchell: And sandy at maybe at this point, simply maintaining a list of tasks that are done that have been done a running log of what was done.

534
01:07:47.400 --> 01:08:01.800
Kip Twitchell: Maybe, all we can do at this point in terms of that just to keep us making progress, but that list of tasks that we've done to do that, then becomes the basis for for building it in a more automated way if we're short on capacity at this point.

535
01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:02.640
sure.

536
01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.550
Kip Twitchell: we're at our hour here.

537
01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:16.740
Kip Twitchell: We have not covered everything that we had in the agenda but.

538
01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:19.080
Kip Twitchell: we've covered a lot of them.

539
01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:25.410
Kip Twitchell: Are there other items that we need to discuss here, and if we go a minute long.

540
01:08:30.810 --> 01:08:34.290
Andrea Orth: I have some ozzy questions, but I want to leave space for.

541
01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:39.990
Andrea Orth: me, can you bet your ass is from anyone else good.

542
01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.930
Kip Twitchell: i'll hang on and we've discussed this a bit.

543
01:08:48.210 --> 01:09:02.640
Ian: I had a total aside thing of the open mainframe i've just posted a link to it, the they're doing an open mainframe education project anybody out there who wants to help the outside world stick your hand up and.

544
01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:12.360
Ian: it's the the as the summary of that project is you guys are all getting old, we need to replace you.

545
01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:15.840
Ian: that's what the projects all about.

546
01:09:16.410 --> 01:09:17.700
Kip Twitchell: yeah that's interesting.

547
01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.250
NeilBeesley: that's a nice way of putting it.

548
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:24.600
Ian: yeah I was gonna be used the oC binocular it decided that.

549
01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:26.280
Ian: You know, politically correct.

550
01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:30.720
bobmcCormack: What about the case of us that are too old already.

551
01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:33.930
Ian: yeah.

552
01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:41.460
Ian: I put my hand up to say I would help, but I don't know what I can do.

553
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:43.050
Kip Twitchell: Very good.

554
01:09:48.030 --> 01:10:02.700
Kip Twitchell: Okay, then maybe we'll close off our meeting Andrea I can hang on here, and if anyone wants to hang on listen to the discussion happy to have that you've got other things to do, thank you for joining we'll meet again in two weeks and charge forward.

555
01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:04.140
Randall Ness: Okay.

556
01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:05.490
Eugene Morrow: Thank you, Kim.

557
01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.170
Kip Twitchell: Thanks everybody.

558
01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:08.430
Ian: say.

559
01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:10.860
Randall Ness: Thanks guys bye.

560
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:19.800
Kip Twitchell: Andrea do you want to go ahead.

561
01:10:20.190 --> 01:10:25.320
Andrea Orth: There, so when you're talking about when we're in the wordpress another option section.

562
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:29.850
Andrea Orth: made me wonder has anyone purchased the domains for Rosa yet.

563
01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.420
Kip Twitchell: No good good question.

564
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:38.490
Kip Twitchell: Maybe I should just do that directly with john right.

565
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:41.010
Andrea Orth: Probably the easiest good.

566
01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:46.140
Kip Twitchell: i'll follow up with him, so I got two questions for john right one on.

567
01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:53.700
Kip Twitchell: going directly to our repo and then that question on the ozzy domain name.

568
01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:54.540
yeah.

569
01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.440
Kip Twitchell: I wonder if the domain names out there, maybe I should go see.

570
01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.430
Kip Twitchell: godaddy that's where I go.

571
01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.440
Andrea Orth: Yes, you are I know so.

572
01:11:15.090 --> 01:11:18.000
Kip Twitchell: policy.org is available for $25,000.

573
01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.390
Andrea Orth: To be Osborne.

574
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:34.530
Kip Twitchell: Okay, but, as always, E dash e.org is only $10 a year so just a little bit difference there.

575
01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:40.020
Sandy Peresie: So instead of oC G it's nosey dash.

576
01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.430
Kip Twitchell: dash yeah.

577
01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:44.130
yeah.

578
01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:48.510
doesn't matter.

579
01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:55.140
Andrea Orth: And then that's probably another group that needs a portal website as well.

580
01:11:56.610 --> 01:12:02.220
Kip Twitchell: Like yeah for the like what we have with us today right.

581
01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:04.020
Andrea Orth: Because it yeah.

582
01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.450
Kip Twitchell: yeah Andrew that's a good thought.

583
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:16.860
Andrea Orth: At a minimum i'd like something as I keep dropping open mainframe projects and our internal social media.

584
01:12:18.090 --> 01:12:20.970
Andrea Orth: that's one project where i'd like to you know.

585
01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:26.310
Kip Twitchell: Point it's a broad appeal isn't there Andrea do people get Ahold of that and they say oh that's really interesting.

586
01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:29.430
Andrea Orth: Well that's what i'm hoping will someday happen.

587
01:12:30.090 --> 01:12:36.540
Andrea Orth: yeah I mean I name dropped five or six llp projects today just to media.

588
01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:38.850
Andrea Orth: I don't know if.

589
01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.480
Andrea Orth: they're okay thinkers but I did.

590
01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:57.900
Kip Twitchell: yep no sandy that's a good point that and that that Andrew has given us there is that having having a website, in addition to just our github site having something that's a bit more consumable than a readme document.

591
01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:01.110
Kip Twitchell: would be helpful in getting our word out further.

592
01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:04.170
Sandy Peresie: Do we have enough to put on our.

593
01:13:05.190 --> 01:13:06.750
Sandy Peresie: website, I mean.

594
01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:09.330
Kip Twitchell: Well, given my energy level today no.

595
01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:19.830
Sandy Peresie: yeah well, I mean you know I don't know I don't know if I guess the question is, do working groups have websites.

596
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:21.660
Kip Twitchell: You know, is it just well.

597
01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:22.890
Sandy Peresie: We can then have a website.

598
01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:28.110
Kip Twitchell: So we can we can we can we can set we don't we don't follow rules.

599
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:36.120
Andrea Orth: Okay well there's at least one working group hanging off the menu project menu at the one P website.

600
01:13:37.290 --> 01:13:44.220
Kip Twitchell: Listen listen sandy by having Andrea involved in our project, there are no rules that's Andrea comes with.

601
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:46.800
Andrea Orth: Permission a whole lot.

602
01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:52.740
Sandy Peresie: Better to ask forgiveness than permission.

603
01:13:54.570 --> 01:13:55.110
Kip Twitchell: Very well.

604
01:13:58.620 --> 01:13:58.980

01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:30.960
Kip Twitchell: Okay, so you've got permission you got a little bit of brightness there too.

612
01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:37.080
Andrea Orth: I would say i've been discussing with my manager, but I have permission to.

613
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:45.780
Andrea Orth: I would say, just like I can stream the radio or sit at home, I could stream this meeting.

Sandy Peresie: So you know, Andrea um I got a response back from the from the github team well actually two responses I got I got a response back from the issue one.

620
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:22.860
Sandy Peresie: i'm that we're all the things don't show up um but they didn't I didn't like their answer but i'm going to try it anyway, so I think they're just telling me well it's working the way it's supposed to.

625
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:42.330

626
01:15:42.990 --> 01:16:06.210
Sandy Peresie: cool so um hopefully that all works, and then we can move forward, but you know I would suspect it will take a couple of days before actually see anything i'm The one thing that that I did want to ask you i'm just wondering if maybe too late at this point, but i'm.

627
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:14.430
Sandy Peresie: i'm not sure if we have to go back to them if we decide that the.

628
01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:23.010
Sandy Peresie: outreach project wants to be a can ban I think we'd probably want to put it under.

629
01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:33.570
Sandy Peresie: The project that already exists as as some type of an epic because I think what would what we would have to do is go back and ask them to connect another one.

630
01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:38.280
Sandy Peresie: Because it's a separate project, as opposed to.

631
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:48.600
Sandy Peresie: Part of the project that they're already connecting for us so um we'll have to talk about that once.

01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:53.010
Andrea Orth: And that's I mean i've already put a couple.
