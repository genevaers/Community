## Minutes

### Issue 71, Wikipedia Update
GenevaERS page is [live on Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GenevaERS)  

If you search for SAFR on Wikipedia, you get re-directed to the GenevaERS page. The SAFR page does exist and can be edited if it were decided to do that in the future 

We could talk to John Mertic about making a category, similar to the Linux Foundation, on Wikipedia for the Open Mainframe Project. This would allow GenevaERS to be classified under the category Open Mainframe Project

### Issue 94, GenevaERS commercial name
Will remain SAFR as the level of effort within IBM to change the name to something like GenevaERS Premium is great

### Issue 103, Mission Statement
Discussions and suggestions continue for the mission statement. These have been captured within the issue. 
  
We'll do one more revision of the mission statement

### Issue 98, Documentation Approach
Formal approval was given to use Gatsby and GitHub as the mechanism for the GenevaERS documentation.

Static content, such as text and images, are stored in GitHub and treated like code in the sense that documentation updates are made via branching and merged into the main branch via pull requests

Extraneous discussion indicating that it may be time to have a specific Documentation subgroup similar to the Spark group which meets once per week

### Issue 79 JIRA Kanban board
Sandy has been doing a lot of work in this space working with the Linux Foundation to connect our JIRA instance with the GitHub repositories. This would allow issues opened in GitHub to show up in JIRA.

### Issue 112, Linux setup on Vicom Mainframe
Vicom has now setup Linux on USS. Randall is the super admin and can grant / setup accesses for the team.  

Postgress, Gradle, and Java were also installed by Vicom. We can install the rest of the software we need
