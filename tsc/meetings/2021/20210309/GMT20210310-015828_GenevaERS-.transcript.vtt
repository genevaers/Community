Eugene Morrow: Mother in law who's.

10
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.500
Eugene Morrow: In a dimension award and he's doing fine.

11
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.860
Kip: i'm glad to hear that.

12
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.550

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.710
Kip: I have a I have a short story about another.

15
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.970
Kip: Short I got stuck in buffalo snow.

afternoon.

19
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.080
Randall Ness: That.

20
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.120
Kip: Airport was shut down finally.

21
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.660
Kip: ended taking a train at midnight got me to Chicago.

22
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.950
Kip: At noon.

23
00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:13.200
Kip: That I had to take a taxi out to o'hare to go pick up my car drove close to my house stopped to get gas and my starter on my car died so about 4pm I called my wife to come pick me out, but she picked me up took me home I walked in the door, my mother in law, who is.

24
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.280
Kip: Visiting for the weekend.

25
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.610
Kip: said.

26
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.450
Kip: boy, some people go to extreme lengths to avoid their mother in law.

27
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.520
Eugene Morrow: i'm lucky my mother in law's from.

28
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.170
Eugene Morrow: Heaven I get on very well with it.

29
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.890
that's.

30
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.000
Kip: My mother in law's good, to the fact that she could say that joke.

31
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.450
Was.

32
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.670
Eugene Morrow: A good sign, yes.

33
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.420
Kip: Well, I have to admit i'm.

34
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.590
Kip: Under the weather just today.

35
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.180
Kip: So although i'm supposed to run the meeting.

36
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.640
Kip: i'm going to be a little lower than bow.

37
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.090
Kip: and energy and doing that task if that's up that's a problem.

38
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.190
Kip: For the team.

39
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.120
Kip: That, I had a they had, I had a.

40
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.460
Kip: conflict for yesterday's.

41
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.090
Kip: Call.

42
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.160
scrum call, so I didn't.

43
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.140
Kip: get to get to review the agenda very closely.

44
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:38.010
Kip: I Andrea I don't know if you can help me out save me from my own worst impulses here, but if you could help me in in walking through the meeting today that would.

45
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.290
Andrea Orth: yeah and when sandy logs on she can help as well.

46
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.640
Great.

47
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.940
Kip: Thank you for that are we ready to get going.

48
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.660
into wait a minute.

49
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.170
Randall Ness: The other meeting this week.

50
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.840
Kip: I hope not.

51
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.740
Randall Ness: I hope that.

52
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.240
Randall Ness: I don't see her in slack know.

53
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.490
Andrea Orth: Well, we could start but we may have can juggle our items a little bit.

54
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.800
Andrea Orth: Because the first two she would want to provide probably input or partake in discussion.

55
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.340
Kip: So how can I start.

56
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.510
Kip: First, by noting.

57
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.460
Kip: The blog entry.

58
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.290
Kip: On all MP went out this week.

59
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:47.160
Kip: did a linkedin post today other as well.

60
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.700
Kip: So I read posted that on linkedin.

61
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.120
So.

62
00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:04.410
Kip: Anyway, some other is, I was surprised when I looked at the linkedin post, the number of people that had already liked it by the time I.

63
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.120
got to the.

64
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.170
Kip: got to the notification specifically so.

65
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.780
Kip: So there's some good.

66
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.160
Kip: Some good things happening in that space.

67
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:22.170
Kip: Okay.

68
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.190
Kip: I could show you that real briefly sandy says she's joining so.

69
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.640
Kip: He was the linkedin post would get.

70
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.450
Kip: number of people liking this that I don't know.

71
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.080
exactly who they are.

72
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.230
Kip: So.

73
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.470
Kip: The post.

74
00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.470
Kip: is on the open mainframe project.

75
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.600
Kip: That we reviewed.

76
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.770
Two weeks ago.

77
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.580
Kip: So.

78
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.070
Kip: Okay.

79
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.750
Randall Ness: Great.

80
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.590
Kip: that's a brief update on.

81
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.120
Kip: That.

82
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.380
Kip: And we have sandy here, he joined us.

83
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.280
Kip: Tonight share sound going yet or not.

84
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.930
Kip: and rewards where do you suggest we go next.

85
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:37.650
Randall Ness: Well, I could cover.

86
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.110
Kip: somewhat the mission statement is that okay.

87
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.650
Andrea Orth: Yes, Mr ask someone and then do something anyway that sounds fine.

88
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.790
Randall Ness: You didn't.

89
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.110
Kip: Answer fast enough.

90
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:53.400
Andrea Orth: Just forgot, I was on mute otherwise I thought that you forgot.

91
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.900
Kip: you're on mute and that's okay.

92
00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.220
Andrea Orth: Well, this is a typical meeting, ladies and gentlemen.

93
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.150
Kip: it's good.

94
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.540
Kip: it's good Andrea and I are back in true form of how we've worked for.

95
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.440
Kip: years, this is.

96
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.590
Kip: Mike.

97
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:11.490
Kip: Mike.

98
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.650
Kip: will ask Michael to join in in a minute um so.

99
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.290
Kip: As part of our.

100
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:20.430
say.

101
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.460
Kip: Michael.

102
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.010
Kip: that's part of.

103
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:36.210
Kip: Setting up an llc for Geneva ERS which will hold the intellectual property that has been contributed under the Apache to point on license.

104
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.700
Kip: We need to think about.

105
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:57.180
Kip: A Vision statement for our our project which is and easy these things can kind of really do challenge one to get to the essence of what the issues are.

106
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.480
Kip: So that's part of the application process of going through this right.

107
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:12.930
Kip: sandy took a nice first stab at this easier to react to something and to create from scratch.

108
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:30.180
Kip: But her her first job was to enable efficient processing of large amounts of data through use of established mainframe technology businesses have known for reliability revitalized decision making, without major development migrations okay.

109
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:39.900
Kip: um you know, this is, I, I guess, I suggest that we could use a bit of a.

110
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.960
Kip: bit of your you know thinking time, maybe when you're in the shower or you're cooking lunch or something.

111
00:09:53.400 --> 00:10:00.390
Kip: If you had to explain, maybe and eugene using you your recent experience, if you had to explain to your mother in law.

112
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:01.380
yeah.

113
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:18.300
Kip: What what the project is what its purpose is what would be the words you use, because it can be about that long right can be 334 sentences, at last, and has to convey kind of the essence of the issues involved.

114
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.610
Kip: This is.

115
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:32.040
Kip: issue number one or three, which would be good for us to respond with thoughts on and and build this up over the next few weeks sandy said okay summary.

116
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:50.370
Sandy Peresie: yeah that's perfect um you know it's it's obviously needs work um to to I included their link to some of the better mission statement examples all right for different companies and.

117
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:57.180
Sandy Peresie: You know just to get some some thoughts on you know.

118
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:05.550
Sandy Peresie: The different types of mission statements, some people have Nike and Coca Cola, and all that other stuff so.

119
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:18.630
Sandy Peresie: Most of our fairly short um you know to to better um you know focus on one thing um so.

120
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:23.820
Sandy Peresie: You know, obviously, the one I came up with needs work.

121
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.050
Sandy Peresie: After I wrote it down, I was not happy with it so.

122
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.750
Sandy Peresie: Please help work on.

123
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.130
Kip: Any comments questions.

124
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:46.230
Randall Ness: Okay, giving giving suggestions for editing or suggestions for the process, I think.

125
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.310
Kip: I think it would be probably more efficient, for us, instead of doing a group.

126
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:59.430
Kip: edit at this point, although there's randall why don't we take that what what do we think the elements of our mission statement might be rather than trying to.

127
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.160
Kip: Work this method craft the wording right now.

128
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:07.470
Kip: What would be elements of our our state our mission statement.

129
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:25.650
Eugene Morrow: To me, this is eugene to me the core of what they're doing is about batch processing, I mean computing covers lots of things and lots of processes, but it's to me the place where we add the value is batch processing so somewhere we've got to say batch process.

130
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:31.860
Kip: You know eugene I might I might suggest the term periodic processing.

131
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:32.520
Randall Ness: Right.

132
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.410
Kip: Which is a little more.

133
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:46.200
Kip: softer in terms of legacy sense but I I could see that that aspect of periodic processing I think is important now, I can see that.

134
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:54.660
Randall Ness: I totally agree and I, and I almost I almost suggested that i'm just because it is what we focus on it's.

135
00:12:55.050 --> 00:13:06.780
Randall Ness: We don't do I mean there's a lot of applications out there that deal with high volumes and things but we're focusing on specifically the market of periodic processing, which we do better than anybody else.

136
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.490
Randall Ness: But let me, let me.

137
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:20.370
Kip: suggest with that randall I would probably add the words highly high efficiency right the our periodic processing enhances.

138
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.430
Kip: Which is why is why we're focused on that.

139
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.050
Randall Ness: So that's right.

140
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.760
Eugene Morrow: I would have put that further down the list.

141
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.050
Eugene Morrow: kip I would have said.

142
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:46.860
Eugene Morrow: start with a periodic processing then to me it's about removing unnecessary steps to make the whole thing much faster and the unnecessary steps are of course unnecessary reads.

143
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:48.900
Eugene Morrow: So to me.

144
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:56.700
Eugene Morrow: Periodic processing removing unnecessary steps that goes faster and flexible.

145
00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:13.440
Eugene Morrow: Because instead of you, everyone can re engineer their systems, but to do we basically automatically re engineer it instead of having to rewrite your systems Geneva doesn't for you so i'm flexible.

146
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:14.490
i'm.

147
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.270
Eugene Morrow: Sorry steps I think that's the key.

148
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:25.140
Eugene Morrow: thing that we're doing a lot of computing does unnecessary reads, whereas we get rid of the unnecessary reads, which makes everything run faster.

149
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:34.110
Kip: So could I have you react to a phrase that might be shorter at some times i've heard it called straight through processing.

150
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:42.090
Kip: As the process of getting getting rid of unnecessary steps.

151
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:48.870
Eugene Morrow: Oh i'm not so keen on that expression, because then you got explain what the straight through mean, and it could be.

152
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:57.480
Eugene Morrow: You know people could describe it a waste, whereas I think removing unnecessary reads or removing unnecessary steps speaks for itself.

153
00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.580
Eugene Morrow: that's what we doing.

154
00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:07.950
Randall Ness: We remove unnecessary reads and look ups right reason look ups.

155
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:21.060
Eugene Morrow: Now, the result of that is highly efficiency and it straight through processing, but the key concept to me our periodic processing removing unnecessary reads and look ups and being flexible.

156
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.900
Eugene Morrow: I mean, anyone can remove the unnecessary reads, but we do it for you, instead of you, having to rewrite your whole system.

157
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:33.120
Kip: Okay.

158
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.500
Eugene Morrow: Good.

159
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:41.850
Randall Ness: Gentlemen, we haven't heard from you, yet, and I.

160
00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:44.160
Kip: Think how am.

161
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.190
GillianHannington: I i'm thinking i'm I.

162
00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.310
GillianHannington: yeah i'm not i'm not great with words.

163
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.950
GillianHannington: like this is why i'm a you know, several programs and.

164
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.990
GillianHannington: i'm thinking i'm thinking of taking it in but.

165
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:05.550
GillianHannington: No suggestions yeah.

166
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:06.030
Randall Ness: Sorry.

167
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.440
Kip: No, no that's okay.

168
00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:13.680
Kip: just wanted to make sure you feel free to comment your your comments last time last meeting we're hopeful.

169
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.290
Kip: You did better with words than you think you do.

170
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.220
Sandy Peresie: We have a wish list to.

171
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:23.670
Randall Ness: To.

172
00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.550
Sandy Peresie: be able to stream data.

173
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.050
Randall Ness: Through the process.

174
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.900
Kip: Now it's been something that's been on the.

175
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.550
Randall Ness: talked about list for a long.

176
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:38.610
Kip: Time is turning safir Geneva into more of a started task.

177
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.840
Kip: That could what what that would do.

178
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.490
Kip: Is it would.

179
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.620
Kip: allow for periodic refresh.

180
00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:47.310
Randall Ness: But then.

181
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:54.750
Kip: keeping up with any new transaction throughout the rest of the day it doesn't really do away with the periodic processing.

182
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.670
Randall Ness: Point because.

183
00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:01.980
Kip: Even when you have streaming applications, when you have to deal with history.

184
00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:03.120
Randall Ness: To get.

185
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.290
Kip: The starting.

186
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.250
Kip: position started there's a periodic nature to.

187
00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:09.990
Kip: That, but it would.

188
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:27.630
Kip: It would change it and update it so that it's not just periodic it could be periodic plus is kind of but that's a that's an aspirational goal, I guess i'd say that we've talked about for a long time, and really haven't haven't had an excuse to.

189
00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.700
Randall Ness: To attempt that in some significant way.

190
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:37.620
Sandy Peresie: As long as as long as it doesn't preclude us from going that way i'm fine with having that in there.

191
00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.990
Neil Beesley: Just single part in other P for us.

192
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:55.440
Kip: I think that's a good question right if we go to a single pass optimization engine.

193
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.240
Kip: Maybe, something we should be considering.

194
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.650
Eugene Morrow: To me that's the thing with the idea of removing unnecessary steps.

195
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.740
Eugene Morrow: The single pass means you read what so you're moving unnecessary reads.

196
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.750
Randall Ness: And joins so.

197
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.110
Eugene Morrow: Long because somehow wrap up those concepts.

198
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.460
Kip: single pass optimization engine.

199
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:30.930
Eugene Morrow: Oh, I don't like.

200
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.490
Eugene Morrow: optimization engine.

201
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:33.030
Randall Ness: that's a bit.

202
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.800
Eugene Morrow: too complicated.

203
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:47.490
Randall Ness: All right, I think, if you say I think it's just a single pass, you have to say single password the data or else they won't know what you're saying i'm guessing it could be like a single pass compiler.

204
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.910
Randall Ness: And you have to know what what are you passing.

205
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.980
Eugene Morrow: Using single pass of the data means removing.

206
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.820
Eugene Morrow: unnecessary.

207
00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.770
Randall Ness: Data races and joins.

208
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.050
Randall Ness: Okay.

209
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.070
Kip: Well we've got some things to work with their sandy said, maybe.

210
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:17.250
Sandy Peresie: yeah I mean that's you know those are all good terms for for the product certain.

211
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:24.210
Sandy Peresie: mean it just has to be put in a nice format.

212
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:26.340
Sandy Peresie: Is there anything else.

213
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.780
Kip: If so, people could comment here on.

214
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:35.850
Kip: In the in the issue.

215
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.410
Sandy Peresie: yeah.

216
00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:44.010
Kip: Okay, we could probably take away and come back with proposed something.

217
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.010
Kip: That would be more efficient or other than.

218
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.550
Kip: Okay, Andrea as you next.

219
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.210
MichaelShapiro: hey if I have a comment about as.

220
00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:02.820
MichaelShapiro: You said the passive data should we add sequential there.

221
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:12.960
Kip: I think that that limits us Michael and that it's not something is required, we could, for example, or.

222
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.620
Kip: The call utilities every.

223
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:18.390
Kip: sense.

224
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:28.140
Kip: I think we leave it that's a that's not a far reach for the product 21 or something okay.

225
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:36.600
Neil Beesley: And we'll use the term mapreduce before is there anything that we can do right from that.

226
00:20:41.700 --> 00:21:03.210
Kip: So good good point we are just so you guys, aware as i'm having conversations of that Geneva urs i'm finding that the term mapreduce to be useful and giving a sense of what the tool is very quickly to people that it's a mapreduce like tool that preceded mapreduce by a decade.

227
00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:04.500
Right.

228
00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:17.940
Kip: So, in terms of a mission statement communicate quite a bit about the tool I don't know if we need that permission statement Neil in terms of description of the tool.

229
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.760
Kip: Something we could consider.

230
00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.700
Kip: Andrea where we going next.

231
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:42.960
Andrea Orth: one.

232
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.790
Kip: Is issue Andrea don't take over here.

233
00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:59.580
Andrea Orth: Now sandy could probably.

234
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.480
Andrea Orth: explain this better.

235
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:01.500
Okay.

236
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:18.000
Sandy Peresie: um yeah what's happening right now is we've got we've got a an action that's been developed by Mr mert tech, and what that action does is allow.

237
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.020
Sandy Peresie: people to be.

238
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.860
Sandy Peresie: added as collaborators into the.

239
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:30.810
Sandy Peresie: Project all right, the reason the way they do that is through the onboarding they set up an issue.

240
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:32.070
That says.

241
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.040
Sandy Peresie: Please add me as collaborator.

242
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.520
Sandy Peresie: And a competitor in the.

243
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:42.600
Sandy Peresie: In the.

244
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.500
Sandy Peresie: In the Community repo has to go in and typing in an.

245
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.940
Randall Ness: APP invite.

246
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:52.770
Sandy Peresie: All right, in their name.

247
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:56.520
Sandy Peresie: And what that does is it triggers.

248
00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:07.800
Sandy Peresie: The process that allows them to be added as a collaborator in a project team Member Okay, the action that's being.

249
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:23.370
Sandy Peresie: Wrong is actually running anytime someone makes an update to issues it's not running just when someone you know puts an ad invite in okay so there's a lot of unnecessary processing going.

250
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:23.670
On.

251
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:25.710
Sandy Peresie: Now.

252
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.070
Sandy Peresie: One could say well you know.

253
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:44.100
Sandy Peresie: So what, but I think it's probably good for us to be you know playing in the sandbox Nice and not using resources we don't need to use um so one of the suggestions that was.

254
00:23:45.840 --> 00:24:01.140
Sandy Peresie: given us was to put a label on the on the issue so that it will only run when the Ad invite is put on there, and a specific label is also put in.

255
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:11.790
Sandy Peresie: What that means is that, because people that aren't computers cannot update labels all right, one of us has to go in and add the label or.

256
00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:23.520
Sandy Peresie: If we make the change the invite won't kick off it won't trigger So the question was you know how you know what are people's thoughts, how do they want to handle this and.

257
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:46.860
Kip: And can I restate those handy just to make sure i'm clear, so that the, the alternative to be more efficient, is that somebody can add a had me issue at somebody who's a competitor has would have to come to the labeled spot and and make it the right label that would then trigger the.

258
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.110
Kip: process to run for them to become invited is that.

259
00:24:53.220 --> 00:25:04.290
Sandy Peresie: Correct correct it's it's the label and the invite as an issue comment that would actually trigger them to be added.

260
00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.580
Sandy Peresie: Not just the invite comment.

261
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:10.920
Kip: So what we've.

262
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.630
Sandy Peresie: been necessary running.

263
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:20.880
Kip: Yes, we would lose a little bit of we're not having that many, I think that they would loses automation a quick.

264
00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:22.170
bobmcCormack: Out of new people.

265
00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:34.020
Kip: As opposed to there being a pause here and new people being added to the project until somebody did the manual update to do the Ad correct.

266
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.330
Sandy Peresie: It would have to be someone that was committed yes.

267
00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:52.560
Sandy Peresie: You know, currently the Ad invite can be added by anybody because it's just a comment yeah now I would suggest, making that known to everybody, you know because we don't really want necessarily people to add themselves but um.

268
00:25:55.410 --> 00:26:01.710
Sandy Peresie: You know I mean maybe we do you know I didn't put that at invite in the in the.

269
00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:06.360
Sandy Peresie: onboarding I thought one of us should be doing that um.

270
00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:10.830
Kip: here's here's an example right sandy from courage right.

271
00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:14.520
Kip: So would be this comment that.

272
00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.540
Kip: would trigger but this one doesn't have the label.

273
00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:20.220
Kip: To.

274
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:26.250
Sandy Peresie: Well that's not that's not been updated yet that that that action is not looking for a label yet.

275
00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.380
Sandy Peresie: We would have to ask john to change it.

276
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:29.340
yep.

277
00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.160
Sandy Peresie: All right, just the at invite.

278
00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:49.740
Sandy Peresie: i'm actually triggers the invite itself, but the but currently anytime you update, an issue that action is being triggered and looking for add me as a contributor at invites.

279
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:59.640
Sandy Peresie: So if you because you just updated your that issue on um.

280
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:13.860
Sandy Peresie: On the mission statement the, the process has been triggered okay there aren't any ad invites any new ad invites so nothing is going to be done, but the processes running taking up resources.

281
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:15.630
If.

282
00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:19.980
Kip: Comments team what's your feeling about how we should handle this.

283
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:28.530
Kip: Anyone.

284
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:38.670
GillianHannington: I don't fully understand it, but if it's if it's a way of doing more efficiently than that's isn't that part of our mission statement to be more.

285
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.730
Kip: Efficient So yes, go with the suggestion.

286
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:50.760
Kip: I think that that's a good reason to decide that as any Jillian so.

287
00:27:53.910 --> 00:28:00.120
Kip: So sandy I think you've got a proposal there we go with the most efficient approach possible.

288
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.050
Sandy Peresie: sounds good Oh, what the gentleman.

289
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.050
Sandy Peresie: and get a label out there.

290
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:24.600
Kip: You.

291
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.150
Kip: Okay.

292
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:37.740
Kip: Next.

293
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.050
Andrea Orth: 99.

294
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.860
Andrea Orth: Probably update on the password removal and further discussion isn't it Sir.

295
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:49.410
Kip: Thank you, Andrea.

296
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.500
Kip: what's our status.

297
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:53.820
On this.

298
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.910
Randall Ness: yeah it's not able to attend today, so he would normally be the one talking about this.

299
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.950
Kip: Do you want to take that role.

300
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.820
Randall Ness: randall and.

301
00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:06.960
Kip: and Michael control.

302
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:08.280
Kip: potshots from the field.

303
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.890
Randall Ness: I think I think Michael could describe.

304
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:15.300
Randall Ness: Our.

305
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.260
Randall Ness: proposal.

306
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.260
Randall Ness: Since it 6000 go ahead, Michael.

307
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.280
Kip: Michael what's what's the status on password removal.

308
00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:26.400
MichaelShapiro: In that denied.

309
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:28.950
Kip: Pardon me.

310
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:34.650
MichaelShapiro: Okay here's what I propose.

311
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:35.550
Randall Ness: To do right.

312
00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.070
MichaelShapiro: Right nights I think the least please.

313
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.040
Randall Ness: That.

314
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:43.380
MichaelShapiro: em regardless.

315
00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:46.740
MichaelShapiro: needs to me, and he doesn't have to remove any code.

316
00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:48.810
MichaelShapiro: From the workbench.

317
00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.540
MichaelShapiro: When we.

318
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:53.910
MichaelShapiro: sent.

319
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.480
MichaelShapiro: ddl to install the database.

320
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:09.030
MichaelShapiro: At the same time we send the script that the person that install the database create the database Geneva database.

321
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:11.040
Randall Ness: Also.

322
00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.190
MichaelShapiro: That script insert.

323
00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:30.450
MichaelShapiro: This particular person as a database administrator in a database so only is this person will be able to log on to database when this person log on into the database.

324
00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.560
MichaelShapiro: As the database administrator this person can.

325
00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.120
MichaelShapiro: Create all.

326
00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:36.810
Other.

327
00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.110
MichaelShapiro: People whatever a lot of user ids.

328
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:46.470
MichaelShapiro: For people who is going to use the database.

329
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:48.810
Randall Ness: So.

330
00:30:49.230 --> 00:31:00.030
MichaelShapiro: Now the regular user and the user log on to the database known thing this user will be able to type in either to store ID and the passport.

331
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:05.670
MichaelShapiro: Bam bacteria so ID will be verified the games.

332
00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.210
MichaelShapiro: That user ID that.

333
00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.520
MichaelShapiro: In the Geneva database.

334
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.570
MichaelShapiro: And let's say.

335
00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.180
MichaelShapiro: Normal more changes are needed.

336
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:18.660
Kip: So.

337
00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.030
Kip: Let me, let me restate their it's not just.

338
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.090
Kip: The existence of.

339
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:27.630
Kip: A person being in the database, but.

340
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:33.300
Kip: they're still as a password being used, but that person that's in the database.

341
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.790
Randall Ness: Is validated within their.

342
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:50.490
Kip: Past 30 so password against psl rack F, or whatever to validate that they can and so we're not storing the password we're just using the user ID to validate password is that.

343
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:57.150
MichaelShapiro: Correct right, the only thing we store on our database is the user ID and that's the.

344
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.420
MichaelShapiro: User tier saw it.

345
00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:14.040
Randall Ness: Again we just well we discussed this with Ian and he thought he thought it was reasonable and we all agree that it was the least number of.

346
00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:24.930
Randall Ness: code line changes and so he said he'd like to give it a try so he's going to give it a try and see where we go, but we thought it was reasonable.

347
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:29.010
Kip: Okay, so since we voted on this last time.

348
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.220
Randall Ness: We should.

349
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.790
Kip: You know reopen for discussion here today.

350
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:42.720
Kip: Is there any do I hear proposal any any more discussion needed by that on our competitors.

351
00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:45.630
Kip: are following this route.

352
00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:52.260
Kip: And if not, do I have a proposal that we should.

353
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.730
Andrea Orth: So, how does it work if you have a new installation.

354
00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:02.430
MichaelShapiro: With a new installation, you need to get the ddl right.

355
00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:09.810
MichaelShapiro: To inside the database right the ddl you'll also receive a script that.

356
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.620
MichaelShapiro: He they scrape the will.

357
00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.050
MichaelShapiro: insert a user.

358
00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.690
Randall Ness: uh huh and like drew.

359
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:28.050
MichaelShapiro: And the user, will be a database administrator so this user after the database and install the user young log on into the data.

360
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.860
Andrea Orth: So, when you say, are they logging.

361
00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:43.020
Andrea Orth: In this is the part my brains, not making the connection to are they logging in through the workbench or through some other mechanism.

362
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:44.520
MichaelShapiro: That knows.

363
00:33:47.010 --> 00:34:09.780
MichaelShapiro: We have the tool currently right that there are two kinds of ideas and to pass the first one is tier so ID and tier so passport and land, we had a Geneva ID in Geneva password right, so a Geneva ID in Geneva password.

364
00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:13.260
MichaelShapiro: That being removed they don't exist anymore.

365
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.670
MichaelShapiro: So the user only log on using tier so ID.

366
00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:18.720
MichaelShapiro: User ID.

367
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:26.160
MichaelShapiro: And workbench does workbench, the only thing the workbench does it verify that this.

368
00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:32.970
MichaelShapiro: tier so ID is exist as a Geneva user in the database.

369
00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:38.160
Randall Ness: that's still.

370
00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.080
Andrea Orth: A part i'm not getting is.

371
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:40.920
Jeff Horner: So.

372
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:42.240
Jeff Horner: This is Jeff.

373
00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:43.050
today.

374
00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:49.620
Jeff Horner: What it is, is that the tsa ID and password is actually becoming the.

375
00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.530
Jeff Horner: ID used in the workbench to.

376
00:34:54.060 --> 00:35:03.120
Jeff Horner: it's it's going to be, instead of having a different Geneva ID and password it's the same as being used as the same thing.

377
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.380
Andrea Orth: mm hmm.

378
00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:06.210
Kip: I mean, so I mean and.

379
00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:10.080
Andrea Orth: me who adds you new users on a new install.

380
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.300
Andrea Orth: that's the part i'm still.

381
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.360
MichaelShapiro: The person who installed the database.

382
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:16.440
MichaelShapiro: This person.

383
00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:20.070
MichaelShapiro: As user before they will be able to use the database.

384
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:26.640
Andrea Orth: Okay, so i'm thinking of a highly controlled environment that like we both work in who is that person.

385
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:34.680
MichaelShapiro: Who installed in the database that's the person is a database administrator.

386
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:35.760
MichaelShapiro: Well, this.

387
00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:37.680
Andrea Orth: let's say it said, my.

388
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.810
Randall Ness: employer a DPA.

389
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.260
Andrea Orth: who's not part of the support unit would do this.

390
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:45.540
Andrea Orth: So yeah.

391
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.260
Andrea Orth: Do we have to pre.

392
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.160
Randall Ness: populate.

393
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.850
Andrea Orth: As part of the script to the users are how and then, how do we.

394
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:54.120
up.

395
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:56.220
Andrea Orth: That.

396
00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:00.420
MichaelShapiro: Only one user a database administrator that's.

397
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:00.570
It.

398
00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:08.790
Kip: Michael once once the that user administrator can go to the Geneva uris tables.

399
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.620
Randall Ness: and add new user ids.

400
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.240
Kip: From that point forward.

401
00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:13.260
Kip: So.

402
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.370
Randall Ness: All that's needed is.

403
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:16.650
Kip: To andrea's point you could.

404
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:19.500
Kip: Pre populate the script with a set of users.

405
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.260
Kip: And those people could also.

406
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.100
Kip: be enabled to add new users as well, is that not true.

407
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.100
MichaelShapiro: Correct you can do this way too.

408
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:38.040
Andrea Orth: But you're you're going through you're either going to run a script, which is the database or someone in this would.

409
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.690
Randall Ness: never happen at my employer.

410
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:42.570
Andrea Orth: going directly in and doing an answer.

411
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.820
MichaelShapiro: is well.

412
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:46.170
Kip: Since they use.

413
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:53.880
Kip: They can use the workbench once it's been in sort of them database, then they can use the workbench to add new users to the table.

414
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.030
Andrea Orth: That was the part I was not saying.

415
00:36:58.620 --> 00:36:58.950
Kip: Am I.

416
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.390
Kip: Stating that correct Michael.

417
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.670
MichaelShapiro: Yes, and so, for example.

418
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.780
MichaelShapiro: I got a script for me right.

419
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:10.680
MichaelShapiro: to install the database and also this particular.

420
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.980
MichaelShapiro: group of installing the database.

421
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.470
MichaelShapiro: There is an insert.

422
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:34.320
MichaelShapiro: My chair so ID as a database administrator when I run it created to the database and install the one birch workbench I can connect to that workbench go in there and then start adding user.

423
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:43.260
MichaelShapiro: Whoever is supposed to be they're supposed to use an assigned the users, the environments permissions and all other stuff.

424
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:49.440
Andrea Orth: yeah that would, if there was ever a install of.

425
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:49.860
The.

426
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.140
Andrea Orth: Open Source.

427
00:37:52.350 --> 00:38:00.360
Andrea Orth: source Geneva Paris I don't think the solution would work would go over well, it might come my employer why.

428
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:08.280
Andrea Orth: Because if the person who's going to create the new workbench would it would be a bba and then.

429
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:15.570
Andrea Orth: Unless you're going to share credentials, the DDA is going to have to make the updates and that's not what db as new they're married.

430
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.240
Kip: No, no.

431
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:27.900
MichaelShapiro: No, no it's not the road, what do you do, that the DPA let's say you did the a is the person who's creating the database.

432
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.390
Andrea Orth: player that person.

433
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:31.950
has to be a da.

434
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.810
MichaelShapiro: Yes, no, no.

435
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:40.050
MichaelShapiro: let's say you you don't want to deviate to become a junior administrators right.

436
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:46.860
MichaelShapiro: Right Okay, then what what you do, you get the script to deviate to install the database.

437
00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:48.210
MichaelShapiro: And then that screen.

438
00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:49.650
MichaelShapiro: There is only one.

439
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:57.930
MichaelShapiro: insert of the person who you think will be a genius to administrate.

440
00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:13.170
MichaelShapiro: And then that script this person rounds and being inserted the keys to store it of that person is being inserted into the Geneva database that say so deviate cannot look going into the.

441
00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:13.800
workbench.

442
00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:16.620
Kip: Only.

443
00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:19.770
MichaelShapiro: That particular designated person yeah.

444
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:21.150
MichaelShapiro: OK.

445
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:28.200
Kip: So the DPA would be adding the appropriate user ID for whoever is going to be the Geneva year as administrator.

446
00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:29.640
MichaelShapiro: Right.

447
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:39.000
Kip: Let me ask a different question from my summary here on the screen, so it seems to me that there's two verifications that are going on.

448
00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.550
Kip: One is this person's.

449
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:50.160
Kip: ETS oh ID a valid Geneva user, and that is simply looking at the table for valid users.

450
00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:53.310
Kip: If I understood correctly, though they're also giving their.

451
00:39:53.310 --> 00:40:02.730
Kip: Ts old password and somehow we're also validating that they have to sell access and that password is right for T so.

452
00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:11.010
MichaelShapiro: Because the first screen that when the user open the workbench it will require user to enter the idea so ID and.

453
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:11.670
password.

454
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.280
MichaelShapiro: The workbench will be.

455
00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.050
MichaelShapiro: filled the world West will be able to.

456
00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:16.800
Randall Ness: connect.

457
00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:17.850
Randall Ness: To the database.

458
00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:20.220
MichaelShapiro: If this user doesn't have.

459
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:27.120
MichaelShapiro: Proper credentials this user will never be able to log on to the world where good.

460
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:39.030
Kip: This actually verify the second step verifies that this person's user ID isn't actually the is the the password is known by the person that using that user writing.

461
00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.510
MichaelShapiro: Right, nobody because we don't store.

462
00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.020
Randall Ness: passwords in the database yep.

463
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:47.790
MichaelShapiro: In the press spot.

464
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.490
Randall Ness: or user type is in.

465
00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:55.800
Randall Ness: Okay.

466
00:40:57.450 --> 00:40:59.430
Kip: Other questions any other questions.

467
00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:05.040
Kip: Okay.

468
00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.300
Andrea Orth: i've made a statement before don't code things for.

469
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.430
Andrea Orth: My for my employer.

470
00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:12.690
Andrea Orth: On.

471
00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.340
Randall Ness: So that i'll just.

472
00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:16.020
Andrea Orth: play that role here as well.

473
00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.160
yeah.

474
00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:26.580
Kip: I think I think there's value in this, though, Andrea in that it preserves it's the least number of changes to.

475
00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:31.110
Andrea Orth: tuition of the program is what you're looking at.

476
00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:39.210
Andrea Orth: um but I don't also I do don't support that correct my employer, so I would never have.

477
00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:39.900
Randall Ness: To find.

478
00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:42.570
Andrea Orth: This change to someone.

479
00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:46.020
Andrea Orth: hears about our other process.

480
00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.280
MichaelShapiro: So Andrew why it wouldn't work with your employer.

481
00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:57.150
Andrea Orth: Well it's not a matter of work, would you really haven't gained anything here I mean your original proposal, if you just.

482
00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:57.720
Andrea Orth: created.

483
00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.370
Andrea Orth: The workbench is a code editor.

484
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:02.910
Andrea Orth: would actually be much simpler i'm.

485
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.160
Kip: You know i'm Andrea.

486
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:10.890
Kip: To that point, I think that we are considering for the new interface approach.

487
00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:12.900
Kip: That we would go out you're talking about.

488
00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:16.290
Andrea Orth: right that was that's the long term approach.

489
00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:16.950
yeah.

490
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.040
Andrea Orth: I mean this this solution is really.

491
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.650
Randall Ness: only get us through the batch process is what this is.

492
00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:36.930
Kip: Well, I think that there's value in in this solution, perhaps for simplified view creation processes simplified rules editing processes, this may still have value in the in the existing workbench.

493
00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:44.220
Kip: that's why i'm hesitant some of the feedback i've gotten is.

494
00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:48.450
Kip: don't jettison the workbench but functionally stabilize it.

495
00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.460
Kip: While we work on.

496
00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:54.000
Kip: The more language editing approach to the problem.

497
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:59.610
Andrea Orth: Well, I think that would be another discussion on.

498
00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.750
Randall Ness: This specific solution that.

499
00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.790
Andrea Orth: This whole issue was caused because.

500
00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:08.700
Andrea Orth: The current product doesn't meet the badge requirements.

501
00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.280
Kip: Yes, because the ci yep.

502
00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:15.450
Andrea Orth: So that's why we're really been discussing this yep.

503
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:16.260
Kip: that's right.

504
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:19.350
Andrea Orth: And yeah, this is just a short term.

505
00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:21.030
Randall Ness: and

506
00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:24.480
Andrea Orth: i'm not in love with it, but I don't.

507
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:25.170
Randall Ness: have to live with it.

508
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:32.460
Kip: Other feelings from the conductor's.

509
00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.790
Kip: Three here yay for this.

510
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:38.970
yay.

511
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:40.590
Randall Ness: yay.

512
00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.210
Kip: anyone else any names.

513
00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:49.950
Randall Ness: But you know it doesn't mean.

514
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:55.290
Randall Ness: Symbolic protest vote.

515
00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:58.770
Randall Ness: pretty much so yeah.

516
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.320
Kip: asked by the slimmest of margins.

517
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:14.400
Kip: Thank you.

518
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:18.960
Kip: I guess actually we could potentially disclose.

519
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.200
That.

520
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:21.000
Randall Ness: Or we could.

521
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:23.850
Kip: Have in review that I guess, to make sure that.

522
00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.030
Kip: documentation approaches that next standard.

523
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:31.830
Andrea Orth: yeah.

524
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:36.480
Kip: I noted in your slack discussion you.

525
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.100
Kip: said you had a local version of.

526
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:42.300
Andrea Orth: Something really.

527
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.210
Randall Ness: did get that running this evening.

528
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:47.640
Kip: i'm sure.

529
00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:50.100
Andrea Orth: I get yeah I could do that oh.

530
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:53.250
Andrea Orth: yeah.

531
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:55.650
Andrea Orth: Have you enable sharing.

532
00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:56.730
yeah.

533
00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.610
Kip: Good question.

534
00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:14.310
Kip: Okay you're.

535
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.750
Andrea Orth: You should see, let me get to the main page, the main page.

536
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:45.030
Andrea Orth: Keep clicking where I think Tom should go and it doesn't go okay here, the main page.

537
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.840
Andrea Orth: So ian's prototype has.

538
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:54.360
Andrea Orth: Hopefully kind of pre populated um.

539
00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:55.650
Andrea Orth: What this.

540
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.270
Andrea Orth: site could look like.

541
00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:58.410
Andrea Orth: In the future.

542
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:03.870
Andrea Orth: behind the scenes, all the static content is markdown power.

543
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:11.550
Andrea Orth: you're going to have images, if you want I think Ian recommended last time.

544
00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:14.340
Andrea Orth: That you only use them when necessary and.

545
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:34.410
Andrea Orth: I don't recall why but, as you can see here you have your left nav, which is a babes kind of well just like your left nav have a menu on a web page and then over on your right is kind of like the i'll call it a table of.

546
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:35.070
Andrea Orth: content.

547
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:37.170
Andrea Orth: or an individual page.

548
00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.990
Andrea Orth: And it what shows up here is keyed off of.

549
00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.450
Andrea Orth: Your headers.

550
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:55.380
Andrea Orth: As you are quoted coded them in the markdown and then you can see, at the bottom, it will pre populate.

551
00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.380
Andrea Orth: What the next page is.

552
00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:10.140
Andrea Orth: i'm not this would be an Ian question i'm not sure it's not clear to me how it knows what the next page is when I inserted a page.

553
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.300
Andrea Orth: It.

554
00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:18.240
Andrea Orth: It knew it existed, but some of this stuff seemed out of order.

555
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.270
Andrea Orth: So we need and explain that part.

556
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.730
Andrea Orth: um.

557
00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:29.400
Kip: So.

558
00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:32.880
Kip: Andrea what France discussion what What would you like to.

559
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:35.730
Randall Ness: Do a result of this discussion to be.

560
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:37.020
Kip: feedback on this.

561
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:38.970
Andrea Orth: um.

562
00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.300
Andrea Orth: yeah um.

563
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:44.340
Randall Ness: yeah probably.

564
00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:48.660
Andrea Orth: That would be a good start just feedback I don't know if everyone.

565
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:56.340
Andrea Orth: Is everyone have a good grasp, though, of kind of behind the scenes.

566
00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:01.800
Andrea Orth: How, you would create content.

567
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:09.870
Kip: Right, I should, could you cover them briefly so can the content simply be a get repository set of.

568
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:10.500
Randall Ness: content.

569
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:13.410
Andrea Orth: Yes, because in in EMS little.

570
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:17.310
Andrea Orth: static page example you clone his repository.

571
00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.120
Andrea Orth: run it locally um.

572
00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:23.310
Andrea Orth: and

573
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:28.650
Andrea Orth: From there on out i'm going to share my desktop.

574
00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:49.770
Kip: so effectively while you're doing that Andrew are are a Geneva ERS slash Doc repository would contain both this code base to present this plus the content that we need to be displayed within the website right.

575
00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:56.640
Eugene Morrow: Yes, of course.

576
00:48:58.650 --> 00:48:59.010
Andrea Orth: Okay.

577
00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:11.550
Kip: In terms of feedback I like the layout I like the format, I, like the functionality having done enough websites, now the you know table of content, showing up there, and those linkages.

578
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:19.440
Kip: And there's a lot of value in those things being automated in the best possible ways I know that the case.

579
00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:27.150
Kip: eugene do you have any comments I mean more on this, what what's your thoughts.

580
00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:28.980
Eugene Morrow: If I was going to talk about.

581
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:39.300
Eugene Morrow: a lower level issue data versus knockdown, this is clearly I I documentation that we use markdown he's using I believe.

582
00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:39.930
Eugene Morrow: gets be.

583
00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:52.650
Eugene Morrow: to drive this gets be, in the end, the source files that it will display our map down fast and it's sort of thing where once you do commit to a new markdown file, it will.

584
00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:56.670
Randall Ness: Immediately update your website you've got it.

585
00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.530
Randall Ness: So it's a very fast.

586
00:49:58.590 --> 00:49:59.940
Randall Ness: way of getting changes in.

587
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:02.190
Randall Ness: Your documentation system.

588
00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:09.240
Kip: The alternative, though, for data is more flexibility that sense.

589
00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:10.320
Randall Ness: eugene right.

590
00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.620
Eugene Morrow: issues with data.

591
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:14.760
Eugene Morrow: i'll get on to that later.

592
00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:26.400
Eugene Morrow: But this is driven by markdown and is used by many other software products in the world, and you could argue, is actually possibly the number one way of documenting software products now.

593
00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:33.840
Eugene Morrow: Effectively markdown through github he said very common way of documenting your product.

594
00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:37.500
Randall Ness: Is.

595
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:38.790
Kip: Good information.

596
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:46.980
Kip: What what issues besides feedback what issues, do we need to address here.

597
00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:51.180
Andrea Orth: I think.

598
00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.300
Andrea Orth: I think the only issue.

599
00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:56.340
Andrea Orth: would be.

600
00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:07.860
Andrea Orth: We would have to in would have to get it running enough because right now, when you run it local, you have to do.

601
00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:09.720
Andrea Orth: um.

602
00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:18.630
Andrea Orth: No, I was gonna say something all all this magic hat does happen automatically even on the local one.

603
00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:23.940
Andrea Orth: um i'm not sure what you would have left to do.

604
00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:31.200
Andrea Orth: To if there's anything in the coding, he has to make it happen.

605
00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:34.170
Andrea Orth: Like for real.

606
00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:36.000
Andrea Orth: On a real co domain.

607
00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:40.080
Kip: How much of what he's done is a prototype as opposed to something.

608
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:41.250
Andrea Orth: that's much better.

609
00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:44.850
Andrea Orth: And then I think you can just be.

610
00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:54.210
Andrea Orth: kind of a training DEMO or video maybe of then, how do you create the markdown.

611
00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.280
Andrea Orth: Or how do you.

612
00:51:56.310 --> 00:51:57.870
Andrea Orth: create these little little.

613
00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:06.060
Andrea Orth: Sub menu things I mean his readme his district is instructions in the readme are very good, but.

614
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:11.460
Andrea Orth: It does and i've even used systems like this before it does.

615
00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:16.560
Andrea Orth: take just a little bit of getting used to a little bit of a just.

616
00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:24.090
Eugene Morrow: And this is eugene I hope to be producing a document on how to do it.

617
00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:29.250
Eugene Morrow: So you want to contribute to help well here's how you create something on the left hand margin there.

618
00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:30.960
Eugene Morrow: He said you create a new topic.

619
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:32.400
Randall Ness: and so on and so on.

620
00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:34.020
Eugene Morrow: So show people what they need.

621
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:34.350
Randall Ness: To do.

622
00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:43.200
Eugene Morrow: To create a markdown file markdown file and where, to put it in and how to get it all working in film, so it leaves out to me at some stage i'll get you a document on how to do that.

623
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:44.790
Kip: We agree.

624
00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:50.100
Andrea Orth: Let takes care of one issue.

625
00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:52.890
Andrea Orth: um.

626
00:52:55.170 --> 00:52:55.980
Andrea Orth: I guess.

627
00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.500
Andrea Orth: Do we want to wait till a meeting where.

628
00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:00.540
Andrea Orth: ian's back where we can.

629
00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:09.600
Andrea Orth: I don't know is this, this is probably a item that we need to like take a boat on once we feel like we have enough information on what we're voting on.

630
00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:12.990
Kip: I mean I my sense Andrea.

631
00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.510
Kip: That you've given us a lot of information.

632
00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:20.340
Kip: Being able to get it up and running, there is the question of how much more.

633
00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:21.690
Kip: Work needs to go on.

634
00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:39.000
Kip: To make it automatic, in a sense, so I guess, we could differ based upon that question, but I don't see I don't see anything with eugene's input here as well, I think this is a direction that seems very good to be going.

635
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:51.750
Eugene Morrow: I like the direction to um, I would like to have in back here to talk about what he wants to do as well he's obviously got a prototype together, but it may not be a complete prototype yet and.

636
00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:53.340
Randall Ness: It would be good to know his thoughts on.

637
00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:53.970
Randall Ness: what's missing.

638
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.810
Kip: So Andrew why don't we leave it at that that will follow up with.

639
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:09.270
Kip: With with him to find out what what's remaining to make it more of a production ready system.

640
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:15.960
Andrea Orth: And then just a reminder.

641
00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:19.080
Andrea Orth: We want to do this for real john.

642
00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:26.280
Andrea Orth: The company notify net a Phi that defy um.

643
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.940
Andrea Orth: Well, similar to the other stuff.

644
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:30.210
Randall Ness: It.

645
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.240
Randall Ness: It will give screen posting.

646
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:35.160
Andrea Orth: For the little bit of.

647
00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:36.360
Andrea Orth: The web server.

648
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:40.140
Andrea Orth: type of stuff necessary for this yeah yeah.

649
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:45.870
Kip: We need to follow up with that I think that's part of our application process to get that sense.

650
00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:51.660
Sandy Peresie: And one of the things that.

651
00:54:53.340 --> 00:55:03.930
Sandy Peresie: doesn't seem i'm not sure is really apparent, I think you can you can put your mark down in different repositories to be pulled into the same page right.

652
00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:12.630
Sandy Peresie: xena was talking about having documentation for the performance engine under the performance engine.

653
00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:22.140
Sandy Peresie: In the race, all under performance engine the documentation engine is just user documentation in his head.

654
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:31.320
Kip: Good good good sandy I wasn't meaning to presuppose the repo structure in the discussion that could be a separate discussion.

655
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:32.460
Okay.

656
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:37.050
Kip: Okay.

657
00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:43.380
Kip: and relax it's okay i'm gonna i'm gonna jump to the Wikipedia.

658
00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:45.900
Kip: Entry question.

659
00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:50.550
Kip: I spent a few minutes today.

660
00:55:52.170 --> 00:56:14.460
Kip: Looking at a Wikipedia entry, I recently there they did a couple of contributions for potential Wikipedia pages and my sense is that the standards for what qualify for pages have gone up substantially than where we were 10 years ago okay.

661
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:18.270
Kip: As I was looking at this.

662
00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:28.830
Kip: You know this is kind of the edit history of it as I looked at the at the content.

663
00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:35.400
Kip: There are a couple of warnings on the content already right.

664
00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:46.950
Kip: Looking for general mobility guidelines, which is one of the things that I was rejected on reliable secondary sources, independent of the topic.

665
00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:54.090
Kip: If not ability cannot be shown the articles likely to emerge redirected or deleted.

666
00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:55.770
Kip: This.

667
00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:02.670
Kip: This note is from artists 2015 so we're six years away from that right.

668
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:05.220
Kip: But there's been.

669
00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:07.830
Kip: Since that point.

670
00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:13.440
switch.

671
00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:18.990
Kip: Since that point the updates are pretty small.

672
00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:26.730
Kip: there's a risk here I don't know how far to take the risk of.

673
00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.510
Kip: Can we change the heady if we change the heading.

674
00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.270
Kip: The editor may say hey, this is a different entry.

675
00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:37.440
Kip: If we.

676
00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:40.560
Kip: Even if we don't change the heady.

677
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:44.100
You know our updates.

678
00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:50.370
Kip: are probably going to trigger if we do any sort of a large update to it.

679
00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:56.280
Kip: We will probably trigger some sort of a review from the major editors.

680
00:57:57.930 --> 00:58:00.780
Kip: So that's kind of what I wanted.

681
00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:02.190
Kip: Some feedback about.

682
00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:04.110
Kip: What.

683
00:58:06.090 --> 00:58:12.270
Kip: How would we navigate this so that our Wikipedia page doesn't necessarily get lost.

684
00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.420
We could do small edits.

685
00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:18.870
Kip: which would not draw attention to it.

686
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:23.640
Kip: Since feedback comments questions.

687
00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:28.710
Andrea Orth: Well, the one question I have that I don't think anybody.

688
00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:30.090
Andrea Orth: Here can answer.

689
00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:32.550
Andrea Orth: Other.

690
00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:35.190
Andrea Orth: Open Source.

691
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:36.300
software.

692
00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:40.170
Andrea Orth: products have Wikipedia pages.

693
00:58:42.330 --> 00:58:42.780
Randall Ness: Yes.

694
00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:43.650
Kip: you're right.

695
00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:51.330
Kip: I didn't know the other thing that I did think along that.

696
00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:53.850
Kip: That line andhra.

697
00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:57.630
Kip: is getting some advice from the open mainframe project.

698
00:58:58.020 --> 00:58:59.700
Kip: Ah, about.

699
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.780
Randall Ness: You know.

700
00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.750
Randall Ness: So this is.

701
00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:09.330
Kip: This is CB wikipedia.org so this isn't the US.

702
00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:13.890
Kip: equivalent.

703
00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:19.860
Kip: So i'm not sure Zoe has a Wikipedia page directly.

704
00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:23.340
Kip: On English.

705
00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:26.520
Kip: Oh no, this is a city, this is a.

706
00:59:26.610 --> 00:59:27.840
Randall Ness: place so.

707
00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:29.550
that's not applicable.

708
00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:37.860
Kip: yeah so the only thing they have is only.

709
00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:40.620
Kip: there's no links.

710
00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:44.730
Kip: To Zoe so it's not as an independent page.

711
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:50.100
Randall Ness: If this might.

712
00:59:51.450 --> 00:59:52.890
Eugene Morrow: be a little daring to say.

713
00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:58.410
Eugene Morrow: But I can't help feeling that our Wikipedia page for SAFA is not really doing very much.

714
00:59:58.980 --> 00:59:59.280
Kip: know.

715
00:59:59.610 --> 01:00:02.640
Eugene Morrow: we've only got two customers and I can't see lots of other main.

716
01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.920
Eugene Morrow: Train sites tooling around and looking at that.

717
01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:06.270
Eugene Morrow: and get an idea of.

718
01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:17.400
Eugene Morrow: The product, my feeling is let's cut our losses let's not worry about what happens to the setup page let's think about what we do when we get a Geneva ERS page when we.

719
01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.710
Eugene Morrow: We want to put it out there when we create it.

720
01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:20.070
Randall Ness: Will.

721
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:22.500
Eugene Morrow: put some really good beefy detail into it.

722
01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:27.510
Eugene Morrow: Well, I think we should concentrate on let's not worry about spending time on a separate page.

723
01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:37.830
Kip: No, I think I think that's a good suggestion eugene I might take that further and say, well then, if we're going to go that route, why wouldn't we.

724
01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:41.490
Kip: Try to make the changes to the existing page and see if they.

725
01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:41.880
Stick.

726
01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:44.250
Eugene Morrow: to that.

727
01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:45.960
Kip: Because it.

728
01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.180
Kip: But what we're doing there is we're stepping out on a.

729
01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:48.630
Kip: risk.

730
01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:55.020
Kip: We may not be able to ever get a Geneva ERS page independently so as you see here Zoe.

731
01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:03.720
Kip: You know they they're they're tighter on what goes into Wikipedia they don't let product mentions anymore really right it's not.

732
01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:16.560
Kip: it's it's there they're trying to be more of an encyclopedia which is less of a list of products so there's a risk, we would lose the real estate, we have right now on Wikipedia.

733
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:19.140
Kip: But we could take that chance and.

734
01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:28.110
Kip: and see where we end up because you're right the existing page does not give us all that much usefulness today yeah.

735
01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:36.030
Sandy Peresie: Sorry, saying that Zoe mentioned here in this page is not supposed to be there.

736
01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:38.880
Kip: Now Zoe doesn't get their own page.

737
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:44.970
Kip: They this is under the open mainframe project kaeding.

738
01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:52.500
Kip: And I could believe that that Wikipedia now is tighter you can't go at a Wikipedia.

739
01:01:52.530 --> 01:02:11.160
Kip: If you start a company and you create a product Wikipedia will reject a listing of your product as a as a valid entry it's only because Geneva ERS had an entry 10 years ago that it still exists safir that it's still exist in the Wikipedia world today.

740
01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:23.040
Kip: or their opposition to the approach kind of proposed there by eugene of being gutsy and.

741
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:26.310
Kip: Seeing what we can get out of our existing page.

742
01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:34.230
Andrea Orth: yeah I mean, I think the same.

743
01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:35.310
level of risk.

744
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:39.900
Kip: Could you say that one more time.

745
01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:48.840
Andrea Orth: My reading what you just said it's the same level of risk either way, whether it's a new page or a reusing existing page.

746
01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:54.060
Kip: yeah we won't get a new page assigned for Geneva year so i'm quite confident of that.

747
01:02:55.350 --> 01:03:07.740
Kip: And we if we change it, we could end up having the page we have been devised but there's also already a risk of that just because of the nature of the content on it today.

748
01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:13.740
Kip: randall you were gonna say something.

749
01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.420
Randall Ness: I don't have a strong opinion on this.

750
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:20.760
Randall Ness: Know that's okay.

751
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.580
Kip: that's probably enough of the discussion there.

752
01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:28.830
Kip: that's probably kind of the feedback that I I needed on this.

753
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:35.880
Randall Ness: Could we get to the data versus markdown issue.

754
01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.950
Kip: Is that a secondary issue or is that part of documentation.

755
01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:48.120
Randall Ness: is part of its part of documentation, but it's something that we wanted to resolve today okay.

756
01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.090
Kip: i'm sorry I didn't mean to go into something.

757
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.770
Kip: that we need to handle the documentation.

758
01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:58.620
Eugene Morrow: Well, under documentation.

759
01:03:58.650 --> 01:04:00.780
Eugene Morrow: We also looked at that lovely prototype.

760
01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:02.550
Eugene Morrow: That means, but.

761
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.740
Randall Ness: i'm always gonna look at a more lower level part of that.

762
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:13.020
Kip: One go ahead.

763
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:15.660
Eugene Morrow: Well, I will shown.

764
01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:24.390
Eugene Morrow: ian's prototype and it's using markdown in the background, and as a sort of mid level piece of software that gets me which organizing the markdown.

765
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:35.370
Eugene Morrow: That comes to a decision that implies we're going to be doing our documentation in markdown now our existing documentation is in detail.

766
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:43.470
Eugene Morrow: And there's a decision there about are we going to switch from data to mark down originally I didn't like the idea of leaving data.

767
01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:59.160
Eugene Morrow: Because data as a product has got a lot more features than lockdown does, however, I think there's some good reasons why we can go to mark down now there is a web page that discusses why you would choose Dieter and why you choose markdown.

768
01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:02.250
Eugene Morrow: If you like, I could actually.

769
01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:05.760
I think i've got it here the.

770
01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.560
presenter.

771
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:12.270
Kip: Co host you can go here.

772
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:26.490
Eugene Morrow: Right i'm going to share screen and i'm actually my truth it's the one share, can you see it's markdown or restructured text or data choose the right format for technical docs Can you see that.

773
01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.680
Kip: yep right.

774
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:33.600
Eugene Morrow: A little bit further down this page which let's come on this page.

775
01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:38.700
Eugene Morrow: um there's a bit of debate about the whole thing, but then it gives some.

776
01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:49.740
Eugene Morrow: Good ideas you want to use data and oxygen here are some good reasons, if you wanted to use markdown jackal some other reasons now his reasons for using deeper.

777
01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:51.060
Randall Ness: start with.

778
01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:55.920
Eugene Morrow: you're going to deliver a lot of pdfs well, I think the decision about this project has been made is.

779
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:57.720
Randall Ness: we're not going to have PDF files.

780
01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.670
Eugene Morrow: A problem with PDF files is there.

781
01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:05.160
Eugene Morrow: Like a snapshot there a point in time, but they get a date, whereas I think the direction for this.

782
01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:06.540
Randall Ness: Product is our.

783
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:18.690
Eugene Morrow: documentation, will be a website, which of course is living is changing every minute perhaps and will point people towards this website even inside the workbench will point to the website.

784
01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:25.620
Eugene Morrow: So the workbench won't have an independent copy of help inside it it'll just point the workbench other the website.

785
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:31.920
Eugene Morrow: And we won't have PDF files at all, now that gets rid of one of the big problems in data.

786
01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:41.370
Eugene Morrow: there's always the lovely sophisticated stuff for having one bit of help and you could produce a PDF file, you can produce a website, you can produce online help.

787
01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:54.600
Eugene Morrow: three different types of output from one common source we don't need that anymore we're only going to have a website so we don't this feat data feature of producing different outputs from one source isn't needed.

788
01:06:56.610 --> 01:07:06.120
Eugene Morrow: So that's The first reason you might stick with data basically we don't need it anymore, we are going to only going to produce a website, we don't need to produce pdfs and other outputs.

789
01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:16.260
Eugene Morrow: And they're also talking here about reusing content, which is a very valid point deed is very good that have several pages use the same content.

790
01:07:16.590 --> 01:07:25.620
Eugene Morrow: They can all point to the same spot you change at once all the web pages change and we do have a bit of that problem in our hill is actually getting less.

791
01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:36.510
Eugene Morrow: Originally, for example, when you created you, and when you modify the view, there was a different screen, and yet they both had the same fields on it, so the description of the fields was common between the two of them.

792
01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:45.840
Eugene Morrow: or now, it turns out the merge them into one screen, where the corrected you or you edit a view you look at the same screen and, as you need the same information.

793
01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:46.110
Eugene Morrow: You know.

794
01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:47.040
Randall Ness: On that one screen.

795
01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:49.710
Eugene Morrow: So we don't need to share information.

796
01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:58.020
Eugene Morrow: anymore for that screen there's an example where we were doing sharing in the past and data, but in fact, with a new structure of the workbench we might need to do it.

797
01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:06.330
Eugene Morrow: So my argument is that, even though Dieter is good at sharing content, we need to do it a bit less.

798
01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:24.660
Eugene Morrow: And there's an another reason why we prefer markdown to do now here i've got to be step back a bit let's be brutally honest about the documentation, we had this wonderful product Geneva ERS how much is documented the sad news is I would estimate about 20%.

799
01:08:25.710 --> 01:08:42.660
Eugene Morrow: Over the last 10 years i've documented the workbench but let's be honest, the workbench is just the beginning, where you sorts of things out, but I have not documented the performance engine the compiler all these other fancy bits so as a product, I only a small part of it's been documented.

800
01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:46.800
Eugene Morrow: And even then my workbench documentation guess what it's at least two years out of date.

801
01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:54.600
Eugene Morrow: Macbeth Linda did a whole lot of wonderful changes to the workbench and that's been continued buy in and then Ken.

802
01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:59.850
Eugene Morrow: And I haven't caught up with my hope, yet so our even our help for the workbench is out of date.

803
01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:14.490
Eugene Morrow: What does that mean it means your turn to be say eugene when you go to fix it up there's not enough for me I won't be able to do it it'll take me one to two years to get the workbench documentation together, then I got to do all foreman's engine, and all this other stuff right.

804
01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:27.840
Eugene Morrow: So, the reality is it will need to be more people now when you use Dita you use the oxygen xml editor which has a price tag but you need to learn, also the data syntax now that's fine for me i've.

805
01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:28.770
Randall Ness: used it for 10 years.

806
01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:31.170
Eugene Morrow: But I must say it's not a particularly.

807
01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:32.550
Eugene Morrow: friendly syntax.

808
01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:34.470
Kip: Down there.

809
01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:35.250
Eugene Morrow: yeah sure.

810
01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:46.380
Kip: Let me just say I tried using it, because balancing act was done with him it to make videos and it is, it is challenging very challenging.

811
01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:51.690
Eugene Morrow: Now, it is true, there are free, I think there are free, decent editors out there, so perhaps you.

812
01:09:51.690 --> 01:09:52.620
Randall Ness: don't need to pay anything.

813
01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.180
Eugene Morrow: But if we tell.

814
01:09:54.330 --> 01:10:03.090
Eugene Morrow: The customers of this product and the vrs are you'll have to learn data, if you want to change the documentation, a lot of them say wrong answer sorry let's use them.

815
01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:13.590
Eugene Morrow: I really think it would be such a disincentive a lot of people wouldn't want to choose our product, whereas markdown a lot of the world's adopting markdown it's simple and easy.

816
01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:24.030
Eugene Morrow: Now you could argue the documentation is a is a complex it's a complicated product right, we need a powerful tool like data I think detail will.

817
01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:24.990
Randall Ness: turn people off.

818
01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:31.860
Eugene Morrow: will lose sales, whereas markdown although it's perhaps a little underpowered and all need a bit of work to do the job.

819
01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:40.830
Eugene Morrow: People like it and it's easy to learn, you can learn it in an afternoon, whereas data it's a question of days and weeks, already getting used to it.

820
01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:49.710
Eugene Morrow: So on that point of view i'm thinking even go deeper as a better product i'm now one overs the idea let's use markdown.

821
01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:55.710
Eugene Morrow: we're just going to have more we need more people doing documentation I can't do it all myself and.

822
01:10:56.250 --> 01:11:12.510
Eugene Morrow: In the end, will get results faster out of them, if I can do it in something simple like markdown for all its simplicity and lack of features markdown the big classes it's simple and straightforward and people can pick it up and start using it the same day.

823
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:25.320
Eugene Morrow: I don't see with the huge documentation task we have here that will ever get an idea of people together to do it, what if we did it just costs a lot of money, and the question is who's going to pay.

824
01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:40.890
Eugene Morrow: I really think we want this whole Open Source enthusiasm from other people let's keep it simple make a markdown now i've done some translation of my data help into markdown It can be done, ironically, you need oxygen.

825
01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:54.060
Eugene Morrow: Plus data open Toolkit to do it, but a combination those two you can translate your data into marked out, and you can do it in a way that only the website stuff comes out, not the PDF and the other stuff.

826
01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:59.490
Eugene Morrow: And i'm going to learn how to get.

827
01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:01.530
Randall Ness: The most out of markdown I think it's a.

828
01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.010
Eugene Morrow: Learning for me of if we do need to share things how.

829
01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:06.090
Randall Ness: We do it, and I think.

830
01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:06.480
Eugene Morrow: we'll have.

831
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:16.110
Eugene Morrow: A common topic, and the other two ones referred to that topic something like that basically i'm saying I think I can get around the disadvantages of markdown.

832
01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:21.720
Eugene Morrow: For the benefits that markdown is will have on the.

833
01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:23.760
Randall Ness: User audience we've got our customers.

834
01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.820
Eugene Morrow: So there's my summary you know.

835
01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:35.910
Eugene Morrow: markdowns not as good as data, but in fact, in this case I think it's a better choice because we need to recruit people to do documentation and we'll find it easier to recruit them with mark down.

836
01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:46.650
Eugene Morrow: And I think it'll do a good enough job that we can live with the disadvantages of markdown I don't think we're live with the disadvantages of data will just turn too many people.

837
01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:49.800
Eugene Morrow: So sorry to ramble on for a long time, but.

838
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:50.670
Kip: that's good that's.

839
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:59.400
Eugene Morrow: My summary of why I believe this product should go with mark down with its limitations, rather than diesel.

840
01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:00.870
Randall Ness: Wonderful.

841
01:13:02.610 --> 01:13:06.870
Kip: Thanks other comments questions for eugene on his.

842
01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.840
Randall Ness: discussion about his proposal.

843
01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:23.460
Randall Ness: um one question has your changes in markdown can you include other files, can you just basically say here's my texts and, by the way, now I want to copy in this chunk so that you can share chunks.

844
01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:29.460
Eugene Morrow: I believe a new version of mark down is coming out that will do that whether it's here I don't.

845
01:13:29.490 --> 01:13:29.940
Eugene Morrow: know.

846
01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:31.320
Randall Ness: But it is planned.

847
01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:32.880
Eugene Morrow: For the moment.

848
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:34.140
Randall Ness: i'm going to bet that it's.

849
01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:36.030
Eugene Morrow: not going to be there in time for us.

850
01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:51.690
Eugene Morrow: So, as I said, it's like a manual way to include you actually have a third topic, and the first to refer to that third topic, and you simply gives you a link please go to this topic you jump to that topic and there it is it's not an include but it's sort of like a.

851
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:53.730
Eugene Morrow: You know, a poor man's in food.

852
01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:55.350
Randall Ness: I think.

853
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:57.060
Eugene Morrow: I could get around it that way.

854
01:13:57.450 --> 01:14:07.170
Eugene Morrow: Until markdown does have a proper include if it does have a proper include absolutely we're in the ballgame markdown could do this lovely sharing of code.

855
01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:16.710
Kip: I guess eugene that raises a question for me, do you think it's possible that the that the editing tool, not the editing tool, but the display tool.

856
01:14:17.490 --> 01:14:26.370
Kip: would include a feature that overcame that weakness of markdown or is it simply the website displayed to just displays the markdown there is no the.

857
01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:33.000
Eugene Morrow: tool displays the markdown it see doesn't try to think better of it and.

858
01:14:34.230 --> 01:14:35.070
Kip: Now it's probably.

859
01:14:35.670 --> 01:14:48.900
Eugene Morrow: Where we're really good gatsby's wonderful and, as you can see there's some lovely features, they are a table of contents and the left hand margin all sort of stuff that's all done for you and it's automatic let's not ask too much data gets me.

860
01:14:50.370 --> 01:15:00.870
Eugene Morrow: To my knowledge, it doesn't do that it's our job to put good markdown in and i'm doing my best to learn how to translate my deeper into markdown to get the best out of the markdown.

861
01:15:01.770 --> 01:15:09.420
Eugene Morrow: I will need to do a bit of changing and my descent to do the proper their conversion and i'm learning how to do that, thank you for that.

862
01:15:10.890 --> 01:15:12.330
Kip: Other questions comments.

863
01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:15.390
Randall Ness: Could we hold a vote.

864
01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:23.340
Kip: yeah I think that'd be good, I would, I propose that we take eugene suggestion going to put markdown is already tool.

865
01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:24.840
I tell.

866
01:15:25.890 --> 01:15:26.580
Kip: me.

867
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:28.950
Kip: Great.

868
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:30.870
Kip: Any opposed.

869
01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:37.260
Kip: sounds like we were unanimous on this one.

870
01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.180
Kip: Great.

871
01:15:41.010 --> 01:15:42.030
Kip: Andrew, thank you for that.

872
01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:46.200
Eugene Morrow: Thanks.

873
01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:47.460
Sandy Peresie: So that's a decision.

874
01:15:47.490 --> 01:15:51.630
Sandy Peresie: that's a decision and markdown versus devo we have not made a decision.

875
01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.680
Sandy Peresie: Yet speed versus SP capital.

876
01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:56.460
Eugene Morrow: jackal and.

877
01:15:57.210 --> 01:16:00.960
Kip: Of course i'm i'm updating the comment that I made on the issue.

878
01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:05.160
Kip: For that OK OK.

879
01:16:08.490 --> 01:16:10.470
Kip: OK we're past time.

880
01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.650
Kip: Other other issues we.

881
01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:16.230
Kip: need to cover.

882
01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:27.030
Sandy Peresie: One comment just just to just i'm sorry just a question we've.

883
01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.470
Sandy Peresie: The question is um.

884
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:37.050
Sandy Peresie: we're still working to try and get jira connected to.

885
01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:39.060
Sandy Peresie: get home.

886
01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:41.910
Sandy Peresie: Okay there's there's there's.

887
01:16:43.170 --> 01:16:49.080
Sandy Peresie: technical difficulties there Okay, we do have a due date, as I mentioned before, on the jira.

888
01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:50.790
Sandy Peresie: When.

889
01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:57.630
Sandy Peresie: If the if the possibility is not there to do these connections.

890
01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:05.490
Sandy Peresie: When can we have a boat i'm starting to use jira.

891
01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:14.130
Sandy Peresie: Assuming that the connection will not be there Okay, because it is, it is rather difficult um.

892
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:18.720
Sandy Peresie: Can we do we want to wait.

893
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:34.530
Sandy Peresie: Until we're certain sure it's not going to be there before we have a vote on whether we're going to put our visibility of tasks into the jira project or can we make a decision to go forward.

894
01:17:35.190 --> 01:17:40.440
Kip: So sandy can I put that in the comment I was going to make it a little bit broader than that.

895
01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:53.310
Kip: I don't know if you noticed team, but in the last couple of weeks in our prototyping effort on this on number of things.

896
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:57.300
Kip: We have been adding.

897
01:18:00.570 --> 01:18:03.000
Kip: Specifically meal and sandy and I.

898
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:08.280
Kip: have been working more on adding issues and documenting.

899
01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:21.750
Kip: Our decision processes in issues so as we're having discussions we're just opening up these issues and typing the result of our discussions in these issues, the conclusions we're coming to.

900
01:18:24.150 --> 01:18:29.310
Kip: You know, as I as i'm part of other Open Source communities like Apache spark and always because.

901
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:32.850
Kip: Those things run a lot through.

902
01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:42.630
Kip: email, and such so there's an aspect here where i'd asked you to you know I don't want to slow things down for documentation.

903
01:18:43.170 --> 01:18:50.700
Kip: But in terms of documenting any decisions any discussions you're having just taking notes on things i'd recommend.

904
01:18:51.270 --> 01:19:08.130
Kip: Adding issues to those I guess, I say that sandy going back to your point as a bit broader on increasing our our visibility for what we're doing and using our issues list more effectively, which connects them to the jira discussion right.

905
01:19:11.730 --> 01:19:16.410
Kip: I don't know what the answer response would be on the specific jira.

906
01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:24.810
Kip: point of the site what's what's our date for knowing about the the.

907
01:19:27.090 --> 01:19:28.110
Kip: The jira connection.

908
01:19:30.450 --> 01:19:30.780
Sandy Peresie: or.

909
01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:45.930
Sandy Peresie: it's difficult because i'm because i'm working with support, and you know I get an answer three days later, and you know I put in another question and I get an answer another three days later, I.

910
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:52.620
Kip: yeah so what you're saying here sandy is that this is moving slowly enough from.

911
01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:53.010
bobmcCormack: That and.

912
01:19:53.370 --> 01:20:00.150
Kip: You can send their name may not answer just because of the length of time and getting response back right.

913
01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:01.260
Right.

914
01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:07.680
Sandy Peresie: And i'm still working on it, but you know I hate to I hate to see.

915
01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.500
Sandy Peresie: The visibility issue.

916
01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:19.410
Sandy Peresie: um once we go live once we become a full fledged project i'd hate to see a visibility issue and that holding us off.

917
01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:33.690
Kip: yep can I suggest it because we are a little bit over time that we put this as a meeting discussion for next time and we'll have two more weeks of experience, but I think that's it's a worthwhile discussion to be adding.

918
01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:38.100
Kip: That okay sure.

919
01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:46.380
Kip: Any other topics that need to be discussed.

920
01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:53.520
Kip: Thank you for your work team.

921
01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:57.120
Kip: always a pleasure to meet with all of you.

922
01:20:59.310 --> 01:21:01.020
Randall Ness: Thanks good thanks everyone.

923
01:21:06.690 --> 01:21:06.930
Randall Ness: bye.
