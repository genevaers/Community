### Mentorship
Quick notes regarding mentorship. The fall and spring mentees receive college credit. Summer mentees receive a stipend.

Possible work for a mentee; gathering and comparing runtimes for GenevaERS vs COBOL processing of data

## Website Updates
Kip and Andrea continue to work through issues on [sharealedger](https://sharealedger.org/) and [genevaers](https://genevaers.org/)

## Workbench
The work on the COBOL Copybook converter highlighted the issue of the 256 character limit in a LR field. To contrast, a group of fields in a LR can be greater than 256 characters. Gillian is going to take some time to investigate the field character limit

## Performance Engine
