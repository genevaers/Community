### One Year Review ###
The project review before the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) is this week August 12th, GenevaERS will provide an update and have the status of the project reviewed to determine in GenevaERS can move from incubation to active. It would require a super majority of TAC members to move GenevaERS to active status

### Demo progress 
Randall has documented instruction on how to download and install the performance engine. Eugene tried the instructions and Randall made some changes to his instructions based on Eugene's feedback

Other project members are also testing the installation instructions. When complete, Randall will move the instructions from the internal IBM GitHub to the project GitHub Demo repository.
