00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.420
Peter Fandel: Hey, how are you

2
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.090
Len Santalucia: Man, what's going on.

3
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:34.950
Same old

4
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:40.110
Vincent Terrone: Not really changing much

5
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.370
John Mertic: Hello. Can everyone hear me.

6
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:39.870
John Mertic: Yep.

7
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.100
John Mertic: Okay, sorry about that. Hey, sorry about that, as have an audio problem.

8
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.470
Len Santalucia: We hear you now.

9
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:47.790
Excellent.

10
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.070
John Mertic: Alright.

11
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:58.620
John Mertic: Let's go ahead and get ourselves rolling here a couple minutes past the hour. I think we have at least a decent number of folks here.

12
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:06.150
John Mertic: In tradition from last time, I'd love to get someone who'd be willing to take notes for today.

13
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.130
Len Santalucia: Anybody

14
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.020
John Mertic: Is anybody open to that.

15
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.920
Sean Grady: I gotta jump out halfway. So

16
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.830
Sean Grady: I can't do that. Sorry. No worries.

17
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.000
John Mertic: No worries. No worries.

18
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.070
John Mertic: Anyone else who are willing to take notes. It has to be complicated just

19
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.210
John Mertic: Stuff that we can capture action items.

20
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.170
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): owe you some stuff notes from last time.

21
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.650
John Mertic: Well, if you want to collect and do it all together, Bob. That's, that's fine.

22
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.290
Peter Fandel: Well, I'll try.

23
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.940
John Mertic: All right.

24
00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.350
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): I appreciate it.

25
00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:03.600
John Mertic: Appreciate it. Alright, I dropped the link to the agenda in the chat.

26
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.890
Len Santalucia: Hopefully everyone can see

27
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.450
John Mertic: It, it's up as a GitHub issue.

28
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:23.100
John Mertic: I think last time we move the project updates to the very end. So I'd suggest we do that again if that's OK with everyone and maybe just dig into. We have a new project proposal that sound good for an order for today.

29
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.720
John Mertic: I'll fill you in the background. How does that sound to you john

30
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.340
phil tully: To hear me.

31
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:31.110
John Mertic: I do

32
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.490
John Mertic: Apologize for the background noise and having a refrigerator to deliver here today.

33
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.580
John Mertic: Alright, well, I want to introduce

34
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:58.050
John Mertic: kip twitch row. He is the proposal, the he's leading a proposal behind Geneva ers.

35
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:12.000
John Mertic: And we'll turn it over to him to propose talk about the project, he'd like to propose to include into open mainframe Kip, do you want to take here and I don't know if you have anything you want to share your screen I can give you a presenter, so

36
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.480
Kip Twitchell: Yeah, if you could I built a few slides.

37
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.560
Kip Twitchell: In fact, and malaria.

38
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.450
Kip Twitchell: Joel

39
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.210
Kip Twitchell: Joel Devlin. And I joined early and so

40
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.550
Kip Twitchell: Joy's already heard some of this and

41
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.360
Kip Twitchell: Based upon his questions, an hour ago, I decided to go

42
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.700
Kip Twitchell: I'll put together some slides.

43
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.410
Kip Twitchell: And we'll see if this is

44
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.240
Kip Twitchell: Helpful and I'm

45
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.130
Kip Twitchell: Understanding

46
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.150
Kip Twitchell: Of yours.

47
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.950
Kip Twitchell: So,

48
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.740
Kip Twitchell: Let me see if I can get to where

49
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.650
John Mertic: You can see my slack and see your screen, so that's good.

50
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.060
John Mertic: Very good.

51
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.750
Kip Twitchell: Let me turn on my actually I could start

52
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.330
Kip Twitchell: Video as well. So you have a

53
00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.320
Kip Twitchell: Sense of who I am. Thanks for your time today. I'm coming to you.

54
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.910
Kip Twitchell: kip Twitchell I'm and IBM employee now for

55
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.860
Kip Twitchell: 20 plus years and

56
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:16.080
Kip Twitchell: Before that Price Waterhouse Price Waterhouse Coopers consulting. I've worked with a product that originally was called Geneva ers.

57
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.760
Kip Twitchell: And when it came into IBM through the acquisition Price Waterhouse

58
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.410
Kip Twitchell: Consulting in 2002 was renamed to safir

59
00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:26.670
Kip Twitchell: scalable architecture.

60
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:27.960
Kip Twitchell: For financial reporting.

61
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.970
Kip Twitchell: IBM has gone through the process and determined that the

62
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.590
Kip Twitchell: This would be useful.

63
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.770
Kip Twitchell: For them if we open sourced

64
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.750
Kip Twitchell: Geneva safir

65
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.110
Kip Twitchell: As there is another commercial product out there under the

66
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.530
phil tully: Moniker SAFA we have decided to revert to the

67
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.870
Kip Twitchell: Original name Geneva ers.

68
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.320
Kip Twitchell: Geneva is a a

69
00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:53.250
Kip Twitchell: high volume.

70
00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.170
Kip Twitchell: Scan application. It has some affinity some similarity. You might say to

71
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.140
Kip Twitchell: Spark Apache Spark as an application.

72
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.480
Kip Twitchell: It tends to

73
00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.930
Kip Twitchell: Have higher performance than Spark as always been a

74
00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.580
Kip Twitchell: Z iOS native

75
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:10.650
Kip Twitchell: Tool it

76
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.450
Kip Twitchell: Generates machine code.

77
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.240
Kip Twitchell: executes it in parallel is

78
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.750
Kip Twitchell: Been used by a score of customers over the year so

79
00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:27.360
Kip Twitchell: currently in use for financial applications for two very large customers that require the scale of getting through.

80
00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:33.300
Kip Twitchell: Hundreds of millions, even billions of rows in their daily

81
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:38.130
Kip Twitchell: Batch cycle overnight, just before the opening a business in the day to produce their financial

82
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:39.090
Reports.

83
00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:41.550
phil tully: Kind of

84
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.280
phil tully: What is special that safir as a tool.

85
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:50.550
Kip Twitchell: It this kind of described quickly how it was developed. We saw over the years.

86
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.470
Kip Twitchell: That people would do.

87
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:56.130
Kip Twitchell: Transaction reporting against transaction files and you'd see

88
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:57.960
Kip Twitchell: stacked up in the just queue.

89
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.560
Kip Twitchell: All these programs to go read the same file. We said, Listen.

90
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:04.740
Kip Twitchell: We just produced all those outputs in one scan of the file.

91
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.350
phil tully: That would save be

92
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.320
Kip Twitchell: Much more efficient. In addition to that, we noted that

93
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.100
Kip Twitchell: Quite often

94
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.800
Kip Twitchell: We had to do join processes to

95
00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:15.270
Kip Twitchell: Decode tables.

96
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.520
Kip Twitchell: Small description files.

97
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.730
Kip Twitchell: So we made those in the memory to do high speed joins against those

98
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.470
Kip Twitchell: The last thing that was done in

99
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.410
Kip Twitchell: 1993 when it was originally commercialized.

100
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.440
Kip Twitchell: Was it was turned into a parallel processing engine.

101
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.830
Kip Twitchell: So that the history was broken up and each one of these

102
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.000
Kip Twitchell: Things is run as a

103
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.020
Kip Twitchell: Different thread.

104
00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.510
Kip Twitchell: Obvious just a

105
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.070
Kip Twitchell: Another moment or two here and then

106
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.910
Kip Twitchell: You can ask questions and got five slides, but I don't know that we need

107
00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:42.870
Kip Twitchell: To go through all of those

108
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:49.560
Kip Twitchell: The real process that sapper is a compiler, it generates machine code to domain specific language has a

109
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:50.880
Kip Twitchell: Front End application.

110
00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.800
Kip Twitchell: That you define what we call safir views. Those are just a process that

111
00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.120
phil tully: An output that needs to be

112
00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:57.630
phil tully: Produced

113
00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.400
Kip Twitchell: From a scan of a file.

114
00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.380
Kip Twitchell: The model.

115
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:18.900
Kip Twitchell: That it's built upon is the good old bad program of 1000 initiate process 2000 read until end of file and 9000 terminate except that safir in doing that process each one of the views is able to see. So that becomes sub paragraphs.

116
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:27.480
phil tully: Effectively set for also has multiple exit points where times we have written code to decrypt

117
00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.210
Kip Twitchell: IOS we emulate in Iowa accesses

118
00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.410
Kip Twitchell: to decrypt

119
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:37.260
Kip Twitchell: Customer specific table and look up routines to do specific function processes.

120
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:38.670
phil tully: Kind of the

121
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:41.760
Kip Twitchell: The sort of things that it has it has some ETFs

122
00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:42.870
phil tully: Characteristics, but it

123
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.880
Kip Twitchell: Also produces reports, because

124
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.250
Kip Twitchell: It does all the summarization, it

125
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:55.380
Kip Twitchell: Originally was a report formatting tool as kind of lost that over times we've gone to online reporting tools, but has

126
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.410
Kip Twitchell: Rule processing custom development.

127
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.660
Kip Twitchell: Has some aspects of an argument.

128
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.870
Kip Twitchell: In terms of the logic, but it does not store the data.

129
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:11.370
Kip Twitchell: The data can be stored in anything, and most of our customers use actually sequential files for storage of the data because of the volumes involved.

130
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.890
Kip Twitchell: Lines of code c++ and high level assembler

131
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.280
Kip Twitchell: Has Java some sequel. So it's about

132
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:33.780
Kip Twitchell: 600,000 lines of code developed over 30 years was a new version was developed in 2000 where we went out of CIC S. We still have the version three code. We call that

133
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.700
Kip Twitchell: could contribute that to open source if

134
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.470
Kip Twitchell: Somebody was interested in that as well.

135
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:39.150
Kip Twitchell: But the

136
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.830
Kip Twitchell: Current version is all of this.

137
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.240
Kip Twitchell: Set of code that was cold ball.

138
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.040
And some of an assembler

139
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.140
Kip Twitchell: I think that maybe I'll stop there. Let me just

140
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.030
Kip Twitchell: Show briefly we have

141
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.360
Kip Twitchell: Rebuilt recently the genie. The ers.

142
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.770
Kip Twitchell: Website and looking to working on

143
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.290
phil tully: Going out the code. We have a

144
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.610
Kip Twitchell: Museum near have

145
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.750
Kip Twitchell: Significant documents from our history.

146
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.870
Kip Twitchell: Talking about Geneva ers. We think that

147
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.870
phil tully: The application that we're thinking about

148
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:19.770
Kip Twitchell: The IBM will still offer Geneva ERS as a commercial application, but it will be zip enabled.

149
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.480
Kip Twitchell: So if you desire to have zip enabled Geneva.

150
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.250
Kip Twitchell: ERS, and it will be called

151
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:33.120
Kip Twitchell: sapper scalable architecture for financial reporting still that commercial product will require a maintenance contract.

152
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:43.050
Kip Twitchell: With IBM. We have a maintenance team that helps support our customers today will be continuing that but we have a large base of customers.

153
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:50.010
Kip Twitchell: By x IBM people and customer base that we think are interested in contributing there seemed to be energetic about

154
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:59.370
Kip Twitchell: kicking this off. So we think we've got a good base coming from a services background. We've never been supported by licensed software we always have done our development.

155
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:11.010
Kip Twitchell: collaboratively with our customers, adding new features to the product in response to customer needs. So there's so many aspects of open source that we've already been working in over the years as a tool.

156
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.960
Kip Twitchell: I'll pause there. Any questions, any, anything else I could say

157
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:30.690
Joe Devlin: Hey, I was able to spend some time reviewing you know a little bit more in depth about this program for product.

158
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:44.790
Joe Devlin: And what I really like about it is that it's an example of the kind of sophisticated software that lives at the higher level in the application stack for the mainframe and that by getting it into open source.

159
00:20:45.240 --> 00:21:01.560
Joe Devlin: People can see not only keep it alive obvious kind of open source goals, but they can see the kinds of applications that have gotten written over the past you know 2030 years and the kind of day that they deal with, and particularly building the infrastructure for

160
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:08.220
Joe Devlin: Financial applications that are so dominant on the mainframe and

161
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:17.790
Joe Devlin: I just, you know, think that you know as much as we have the basic infrastructure there and things like, you know, Zoe, people will are mostly working on, you know, building

162
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:36.930
Joe Devlin: DevOps and or user interface kinds of things, but we need more things in lmt that represent the valuable applications which are the reason you know people didn't buy the mainframe for Zoe. We're trying to modernize it people bought the mainframe to run these kinds of applications.

163
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:45.150
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Has this application and use it all in data mining. One of the problems that I've noticed from

164
00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:46.410
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Working with industry.

165
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.560
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): With academia, because they're using

166
00:21:50.730 --> 00:22:05.640
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): We do a lot of data mining and AI and, you know, learning machines. But one of the problems is formatting all the data to get ready to, you know, feed into learning machines and things as this with this application have that capability.

167
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:12.240
Kip Twitchell: Yes, it could it could play a couple of different roles in that space. Let me say what it does not play into right now.

168
00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:21.750
Kip Twitchell: The only sort of arithmetic operate it only has arithmetic operations today and it doesn't have an extensive library of

169
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:29.160
Kip Twitchell: Machine Learning kind of modules and and sophisticated mathematical models that it can call upon to do its work.

170
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:39.360
Kip Twitchell: Also let me save what it doesn't do as well sappers highest benefit comes when it's resolving hundreds of queries against a very large data set.

171
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:48.060
Kip Twitchell: And that hundreds of queries often requires that you're waiting at a specific point in time to resolve those queries.

172
00:22:48.480 --> 00:23:00.600
Kip Twitchell: So if you start to get more to an end user query sort of tool. The performance benefits of safir drop away in some respect you still get very efficient pass of the data. But you don't get the most efficient.

173
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:01.200
Kip Twitchell: Path.

174
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:08.460
Kip Twitchell: But having said that, it has all the capabilities of doing transformations of all kinds of data types.

175
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:18.720
Kip Twitchell: To get to clean data and the data sets that we create these very large data sets for our customers are very clean data in very structured ways that

176
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:31.920
Kip Twitchell: Lead them and lend them their ability to use these kinds of things in machine learning sorts of processes subsequent safir, it could be enhanced to add more of those kind of capabilities directly into the tool as well.

177
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.380
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Yeah, I like to see it view the pre

178
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.280
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Processing

179
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:38.850
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): You know, for cleaning the data for the data.

180
00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.550
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Machine learning because you know you don't want

181
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:52.620
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): You want to do too much. You know, you don't want to do everything, buddy, you know, kind of thing. Yeah. So I see it as a step one to process the data and then allow the learning machine algorithms to do their job.

182
00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:53.490
Kip Twitchell: It could

183
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:56.040
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Thank you.

184
00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:01.890
David Edelsohn: Can compute, you mentioned spark and comparisons. At the beginning of this

185
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:17.730
David Edelsohn: Was why, why not simply try to incorporate the best parts of Geneva into spark. If there are certain things that it does better and to make smart spark more readily available on CEOs.

186
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:20.340
David Edelsohn: To

187
00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.790
Kip Twitchell: Let me respond to that just from this. I've done work over the last three years, and

188
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:30.180
Kip Twitchell: Our customers have been interested in modernizing for quite a while now.

189
00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:37.650
Kip Twitchell: And I've done quite a bit of prototyping and work with spark both someone z and often see as well.

190
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:49.170
Kip Twitchell: Well, I just recently as part of our open source work. The last month, we've we've kind of come up with this architectural direction and we could see some intersections here between spark and what

191
00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.990
Kip Twitchell: What Geneva does today.

192
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.420
Kip Twitchell: I might use the term Safra just excuse

193
00:24:54.420 --> 00:25:07.080
Kip Twitchell: Me, I'm still getting used to designating my name correctly. If I ever use it incorrectly. The thing that's unique about Geneva ERS though is that spark Apache Spark is an analytical application.

194
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:21.450
Kip Twitchell: Geneva does a master file update Apache Spark isn't really written for large output processes and that master file update writing process is something that makes

195
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:33.930
Kip Twitchell: Our customers have noted, hey, if I put in my backup capabilities in Geneva. At the same time, it's making doing the daily pass for all of these queries, it can write the onsite and the off site backups at the same

196
00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:35.880
Kip Twitchell: Time and I get more efficiency out

197
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.150
Kip Twitchell: Of it.

198
00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.670
Kip Twitchell: All of that kind of work. They're using each state has one pass process.

199
00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:44.910
Kip Twitchell: To to do those updates and backups at the same time.

200
00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:55.380
Kip Twitchell: I wouldn't think that you would use Apache Spark and add into it, your backup capabilities as well because it's not really written for output right processes. It's meant for

201
00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.500
Kip Twitchell: Aggregation and MapReduce to get you to one answer.

202
00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:08.940
Kip Twitchell: There's also some things called common key buffering that has a unique kind of processing mechanism whereby we do large table joins against

203
00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:20.250
Kip Twitchell: millions of rows records. It's a hierarchy process of match merge that I think of sapper the Geneva, the highest performance and most utilization

204
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.210
Kip Twitchell: It's not something that's in Apache Spark, it could be added to Apache Spark.

205
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:35.850
Kip Twitchell: So there's some interoperability that we're looking for driving in the open source world. Our customers do have things that they'd like to run in Apache Spark, at times, which would be more effective for them on a different platform.

206
00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:48.780
Kip Twitchell: They'd like to use safir workbench metadata for doing those processes. We'd also like to be able to take in an open up this new Java code way of getting processes into safir

207
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.160
Kip Twitchell: So that we can actually become an Apache Spark execution engine for the

208
00:26:53.310 --> 00:27:02.130
Kip Twitchell: Set of functions that Safra can do Geneva can do on CEOs and we think will have higher performance we know will have higher performance art code base.

209
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.430
Kip Twitchell: A customer just converted a

210
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:07.860
Kip Twitchell: Tried to convert a

211
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:10.620
Kip Twitchell: staffer process to Apache Spark it

212
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:22.050
Kip Twitchell: Went from 40 minutes with a lot of tuning some very high engineers involved to six hours of processing time Geneva scale is still unmatched. It's much beyond what Apache Spark does

213
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.810
David Edelsohn: Anybody. Again, it's still the question of

214
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:35.400
David Edelsohn: Making Apache Spark more accessible to CEOs clients.

215
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:43.170
Kip Twitchell: That have some aspects of that we can in the open source world we could work on that we think the faster way to do that.

216
00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:44.910
Kip Twitchell: Is to put out our code base.

217
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:57.630
Kip Twitchell: Have the mechanisms and things that we do within Geneva understood more broadly and be adopted utilized when effective or changed if not effective and improved in other ways is probably the fastest way.

218
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:12.840
Joe Devlin: For us to just i'd like to comment on that. I think if the open source were out there. Not only could the existing goodness be maintained. But if someone wanted to build a highly scalable parallel Rd

219
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:26.850
Joe Devlin: Spark Rd populate or from it, they could do so and will probably be hard if it weren't open sourced, let's do that. So that, you know, one of the back end or, you know, places to which

220
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:33.090
Joe Devlin: Geneva could flow forward if a good slow forward efficiently without having to, you know,

221
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:40.050
Joe Devlin: serialized the data out to data files again but but build that sort of custom populate or the way sophisticated

222
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:57.450
Joe Devlin: SQL interfaces work and you know spark to get all that data in there and parallel would really be the key. And also, I thought Apache Spark in quotes worked perfectly on mainframe and that the mainframe Java is very good and it just works.

223
00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.560
Kip Twitchell: Yeah, but the issue is instruction path length we are

224
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:12.300
Kip Twitchell: We are safir Geneva tends to be 50% to 60% even 70% faster than cobalt. So our instruction path lengths are incredibly short

225
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:18.540
Kip Twitchell: And it's been turned over 30 years we go to machine code that the processes that we've developed

226
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:26.670
Kip Twitchell: So if you're going to a JVM, you're going to be executing more, you can have a longer instruction path length, just because of the JVM, even if it's very efficient.

227
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:37.680
Kip Twitchell: You'll have a difficult time beating the saffron performance. It's been proven by our customers. They have looked for alternatives for a number of instances, a number of times and do not find anything.

228
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:38.940
Kip Twitchell: As the scale that

229
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:39.900
Kip Twitchell: The Geneva has

230
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:51.360
Joe Devlin: But if the downstream processing is more complex than what Sephora can handle. It's good to get that data directly shunted efficiently into a spark cluster. Exactly. That is right.

231
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:56.010
Kip Twitchell: And on the. This is a discussion today with with Joe Right on.

232
00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:06.720
Kip Twitchell: On the like a patch or Apache Spark on the IoT solution on IBM on the users MDS as its feeder.

233
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:18.090
Kip Twitchell: Well, Geneva could use MDS as its feeder Geneva doesn't have a lot of ETS it as an epl characteristic, but it doesn't have a lot of connectors two different kinds of data types doesn't read IMS natively.

234
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:33.330
Kip Twitchell: Reads me Sam dB to and sequential files, but it could read it could use MDS to get to a greater sets of data on z as well. So there's integration points here, multiple ways that this could go

235
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:36.960
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Is there a large list of API's that you have with

236
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:38.700
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): This product.

237
00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:42.780
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Or is anything that you would do with in open source.

238
00:30:43.200 --> 00:31:03.360
Kip Twitchell: Well, we have the terms of API's. The we have API points and multiple exit points in safir today, like I O input and output API points. Look up API points. So, but those have to be coded to the safir specifications. The linkage requirements of sapper

239
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:11.610
Kip Twitchell: Geneva wants to is the primary address space and wants to initialize the primary address space because it's a parallel processing engine.

240
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:23.520
Kip Twitchell: So there's some limitations in that way. And also, again, it wants to resolve all the passes in a single pass of the file, but we do have some thoughts around if we were to open up

241
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:31.050
Kip Twitchell: A sequel interface and make Geneva started task that simply scan the files when it had queries.

242
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:43.680
Kip Twitchell: That it could then become a simplified sequel resolution engine that would give you greater interfaces to the to the reporting applications that are sequel based. So those are all things that would

243
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.270
John Mertic: be driven by customer demand.

244
00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.160
Kip Twitchell: And contributions to project.

245
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.210
John Mertic: Do you already have.

246
00:31:52.440 --> 00:32:02.280
Peter Fandel: People customers, partners that are aware of this proposal and are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to to extend this one way or another.

247
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:06.450
Kip Twitchell: We have not, but as a as a consulting organization we

248
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:12.420
Kip Twitchell: Like I said, we don't have a large sales force and never had a sales force pushing Safford Geneva.

249
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:22.920
Kip Twitchell: So we don't have a list of customers lined up today we are two customers that we have are both very supportive of this and excited about the open source prospects of it.

250
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:36.330
Kip Twitchell: We do have a community of existing Geneva ERS people in dispersion, not in IBM that are in other organizations now that are interested in. And we already have some contributions from them that have started up in the last month.

251
00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:47.970
Kip Twitchell: But we don't have a long list of customers right now that are that are looking for this this this discussion we're having today would be probably the longest discussion we've had about

252
00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:57.780
Kip Twitchell: Jeannie VRS with a knowledgeable set of people anyone that you would be interested in referring. We'd love to hear from them get their feedback about where we go and how we do things.

253
00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:08.070
John Mertic: Often, so I'm very conversation here I'm

254
00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:10.860
Kip Twitchell: Going to make one more.

255
00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.490
I gotta

256
00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:13.410
John Mertic: Go.

257
00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.680
John Mertic: Oh, go ahead. Sorry. Yeah, just

258
00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:25.260
Kip Twitchell: There's some related things as well, just so you're aware, we also I'm running a another open source thought leadership.

259
00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.360
Kip Twitchell: Thing called share a ledger.

260
00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.210
Kip Twitchell: Which is kind of branching Safford

261
00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.580
Peter Fandel: Could be programmed to do a lot of

262
00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:36.360
Kip Twitchell: Different applications, but this is more about specifically around

263
00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:41.160
Kip Twitchell: Ledger's and how we get greater efficiency in our legends, not just

264
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:43.530
Kip Twitchell: On the but any kind of ledger.

265
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:46.440
Kip Twitchell: earpiece systems have Ledger's embedded at the bottom of them.

266
00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:48.450
Kip Twitchell: So that's a related project.

267
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:50.310
Kip Twitchell: That would be supporting us

268
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.620
Kip Twitchell: I also run financial systems edge.com

269
00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:57.030
Kip Twitchell: Which has a

270
00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:59.250
Kip Twitchell: List of resources around

271
00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.610
Kip Twitchell: Ledger's and financial systems and Z technology and and other kinds of

272
00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.710
Kip Twitchell: Things. So these are all supportive

273
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.960
Kip Twitchell: Of what we're trying to do here would be included.

274
00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.340
As part of the project.

275
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:32.310
Sean Grady: I have to leave in a few minutes. I just wanted to throw this opinion out there to see what other people think. But my thoughts here is that this is kind of a first of its kind opportunities for mainframe open source in

276
00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:38.370
Sean Grady: To my knowledge, there's nothing that's really dealing with

277
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:57.240
Sean Grady: Transactional performance in the US Open Source thus far. And so it's it's hard to see where we'll go from this point but I think it's very interesting to to try it out. My, my main concern is just

278
00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:07.860
Sean Grady: due to it being the first of its kind. I don't know where the maintainer is will come from. But I would say that we don't really know until we dry so

279
00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.520
Sean Grady: It's worth a shot. And I can I just suggest to you.

280
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:15.120
Kip Twitchell: We do have a maintenance team inside of IBM that supported by our to

281
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:17.040
Kip Twitchell: Maintenance customers and they will be

282
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.570
Kip Twitchell: Supporting in some measure

283
00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:23.430
Kip Twitchell: The existing code base certainly open source adds a level of

284
00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.850
Kip Twitchell: Work effort to go beyond what we're doing today for our customers. So

285
00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.650
Kip Twitchell: We don't have unlimited capacity.

286
00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.180
Kip Twitchell: But there is a

287
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.870
Kip Twitchell: A a multi year maintenance contracts in place that

288
00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:36.450
phil tully: Does continue to support the code base is

289
00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:38.040
Kip Twitchell: Becoming falling off the edge.

290
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:43.680
John Mertic: Of it.

291
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.870
phil tully: I think from

292
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:53.970
phil tully: From my point of view this is. Well, I haven't very little input on anything happens on the Z iOS system anywhere.

293
00:35:56.130 --> 00:36:05.760
phil tully: From a promise simple open source project. Look, this is, this is exactly where we should be going. I mean, this is a an active tool being used.

294
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:26.250
phil tully: And we want to expand its presence and open it source so and and engage other people, possibly into maintaining and expanding on it. So I think from my point of view, it's, it's, it's definitely you should vote and bring it to the table as an open mainframe open source project.

295
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:42.960
John Mertic: All right, I hear that as a, a, a bring to the table for a vote here. Do I here. I'll take yours as a as a motion to approve their Phil, do I have someone coming behind on the second

296
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:44.310
Second,

297
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:46.440
John Mertic: Awesome.

298
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:52.170
John Mertic: So voting members. You know who you are. All in favor of taking the

299
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:52.890
Eyes.

300
00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:54.540
Enyu Wang: I

301
00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:01.140
Any opposed, or abstain.

302
00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:09.570
John Mertic: Congratulation cap. Your lucky number 13 of projects in the open mainframe project well

303
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.000
Kip Twitchell: That's lucky number 13. Thank you.

304
00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:20.100
John Mertic: Excellent, excellent. Follow all will connect sometime here in the next couple days with next steps.

305
00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:21.780
John Mertic: Thank you very much.

306
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.880
Kip Twitchell: Appreciate all your time that's

307
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:26.460
John Mertic: Awesome.

308
00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:40.110
John Mertic: So next on the list here, we've kind of following up on the SIG working group and I think where we have landed here was using a co working group as an example.

309
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:49.440
John Mertic: We put together a quick propose a kind of a structure of what a working group public life and Kim.

310
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.060
John Mertic: Started working on that.

311
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:00.180
Cameron Seay: Sure.

312
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.540
Cameron Seay: If you can enable my screen.

313
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.670
John Mertic: find you here.

314
00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:12.960
phil tully: Alright hopefully that works.

315
00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:14.700
John Mertic: It does.

316
00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:18.870
Cameron Seay: Um, we found my document.

317
00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:24.990
Cameron Seay: Okay, so I was in the process of

318
00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:27.390
Cameron Seay: Updating the

319
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.340
Cameron Seay: Repo that john created

320
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.720
Cameron Seay: And get up.

321
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:38.460
Cameron Seay: And of course I didn't leave myself enough time for the detail is required for a commit to the

322
00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:42.150
Cameron Seay: Dive to really document. So I'm just can

323
00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:43.650
Everyone see my screen.

324
00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:47.880
John Mertic: Yes.

325
00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:51.600
John Mertic: We can see it. I can, I can pull it up.

326
00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.220
Cameron Seay: No problem. Um,

327
00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:57.390
John Mertic: Yeah, but help

328
00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:00.390
Cameron Seay: Us a little better.

329
00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:02.550
Len Santalucia: Back.

330
00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:04.350
John Mertic: Yeah, there we go.

331
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.160
Cameron Seay: This is where this is verbatim the template.

332
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:21.180
Cameron Seay: Arm that the open mainframe project or the Linux Foundation wants a working group to follow. So I just filled in the detail. So I'm not going to read the first paragraph for you. I'll just paraphrase it we

333
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:29.790
Cameron Seay: We in the industry and those of us that are close to cobalt have determined that there is a need for

334
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.230
Cameron Seay: A focused

335
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:40.890
Cameron Seay: Effort to both explain what cabal is and facilitate people that want to be a part of the cobalt community so that summarizes that

336
00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:53.850
Cameron Seay: Um, and if you need any more detail, I have a much more detailed document on the site. There's a link to the site down here, much more detailed document, but this is just following the template. So I didn't want to give too much verbiage in here.

337
00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.880
Cameron Seay: It said limit your limit your verbiage

338
00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:58.200
Cameron Seay: So,

339
00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:01.920
Cameron Seay: what the goals are and the we

340
00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.360
Cameron Seay: may add to these. And this was

341
00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:05.130
Cameron Seay: input from the group.

342
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:10.560
Cameron Seay: These not not as mine unilaterally greatly increased cobalt exposure to the polls public

343
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.800
Cameron Seay: Specifically the it decision makers who will directly affect

344
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.160
Cameron Seay: How cobalt will be employed in the future.

345
00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:27.540
Cameron Seay: killin Clint is totally dislike describe why Kobayashi returned to the general cost curriculum. That's a big one for me that it cobalt is virtually invisible and

346
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:28.530
Cameron Seay: All causes can

347
00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:29.520
phil tully: Cause campuses.

348
00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.950
Cameron Seay: And gather data and promote call balls.

349
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:33.960
Cameron Seay: Important to the global economy.

350
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:38.280
Cameron Seay: Provide avenues by which those seeking cobalt skills can acquire them.

351
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:39.630
Cameron Seay: Establish a group

352
00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:42.360
Cameron Seay: Of thought leaders and key person in this space.

353
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:44.700
Cameron Seay: To act as global proponents

354
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:45.990
Cameron Seay: And commentators

355
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.360
Cameron Seay: On the language and it's enduring value.

356
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:52.380
Cameron Seay: So before I go on all the any comments on those goals.

357
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.990
Cameron Seay: Okay.

358
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:00.420
Cameron Seay: I'm sorry.

359
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.500
Rick Troth: It was good stuff going

360
00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:15.660
Cameron Seay: Just good yeah I'm, you know, I was a little press to foot the non goes, um, I kind of did these unilaterally and I will receive input from the group. I got crickets. When I asked for non goes but I just

361
00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:17.430
Cameron Seay: We don't want to be

362
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:22.080
Cameron Seay: In the spirit of the open mainframe project and Linux Foundation in general.

363
00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.850
Cameron Seay: We don't want to

364
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:29.730
Cameron Seay: show any bias for it for any particular vendor or a particular proceed of the point

365
00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:31.590
Cameron Seay: Cobalt and we don't want to

366
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:43.680
Cameron Seay: Develop a preference for one platform or over another. Although about 95% plus cobalt is that is deployed is deployed on the on the mainframe, but

367
00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:44.970
Cameron Seay: There are some that isn't

368
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.410
Cameron Seay: So we want to keep that open

369
00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:47.670
Um,

370
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:58.830
Cameron Seay: So well, it kind of was it was your comment. I'll pause for comments. I'm the sponsor. I didn't, I didn't ask him this, but he was a part of. He know he was a

371
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:59.970
Cameron Seay: partner in crime for

372
00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:05.820
Cameron Seay: This this caper. So I just put his name in and if you got a problem with that, I'll be glad to replace it with somebody else but

373
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:06.630
Cameron Seay: You don't want

374
00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:10.290
Len Santalucia: That's fine. Yeah. Now deliverables.

375
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:12.420
Cameron Seay: There are kind of high level deliverables that

376
00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:13.680
Cameron Seay: Out to me.

377
00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.310
Cameron Seay: And in conversation with a couple of people. I'm

378
00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:19.920
Cameron Seay: In the, in the team on the team, um,

379
00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:27.930
Cameron Seay: What I would like to have a highly visible online roundtable with the major person is that

380
00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:29.730
Cameron Seay: Person I'm

381
00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:30.990
Cameron Seay: In this space.

382
00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:33.120
Cameron Seay: People like Tom Ross and

383
00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:41.220
Cameron Seay: That level, um, who, you know, have kind of global global impact on the language and so that they can excel.

384
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:43.200
Cameron Seay: And my goal is to have

385
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:44.820
Cameron Seay: A bunch of students.

386
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.550
phil tully: And people are just in don't know anything about

387
00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:54.180
Cameron Seay: Cobalt because everybody was called knows the role the Kobo everybody's called knows the road cobalt plays and global economy.

388
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:55.500
Cameron Seay: But most people do not

389
00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:57.990
Cameron Seay: Most people do not know that a huge chunk.

390
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.500
phil tully: Of the

391
00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.880
Cameron Seay: Of the world business.

392
00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.250
Cameron Seay: Is done with cobalt application so

393
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:04.740
Cameron Seay: We want to do to make that known

394
00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:07.920
Cameron Seay: And we want to develop a standardized curriculum.

395
00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:10.890
Cameron Seay: For high schools, colleges and universities for teaching cobalt

396
00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.800
Cameron Seay: Is a big. Now, there may be some other

397
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.470
Cameron Seay: I like to. I like deliverables.

398
00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:30.780
Cameron Seay: That are near term, and clearly doable. And both of these are so we'll have other deliverables as time goes by communication. So we have our communication protocol on set up. And so there are

399
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:33.360
Cameron Seay: Various ways you can interact with the with the group.

400
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:40.920
Cameron Seay: On this will be made available that IBM has an excellent on cobalt channel out there for for beginners and novices.

401
00:43:41.370 --> 00:44:03.120
Cameron Seay: Um, right now we're currently meeting of the fourth Thursday of every month at 2:30pm for zoom and don't see any meetings in the foreseeable future in person. Now, I would like to share another very quickly because I know you know time is kind of limited and share my screen new share

402
00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:19.830
Cameron Seay: Some knows. These are Derek notes with with input Derek Britain's notes with input from our was our and I just want to share these with the group because this is where we want to go. So we have core objectives of evangelizing cobalt to academics and I'm

403
00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:26.520
Cameron Seay: Sharing the cobalt on all platforms. Um, and facilitate that.

404
00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:42.750
Cameron Seay: Define and and really quantify this this cobalt shortage and that there's not really a shortage of cobalt programmers. Now, but there will be because it's not being taught. Um, so, um,

405
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.380
Rick Troth: I could say there already is.

406
00:44:50.940 --> 00:45:00.780
Cameron Seay: Okay. Um, but, you know, called bill he shot. He's got a bunch cobalt program, ready to go. The point is, and I'm not disagreeing with your data.

407
00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:11.310
Cameron Seay: But the point is that there's going to be because it's not being taught in universities at all. So whether it is it is not one. Now there is going to be

408
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:12.810
Rick Troth: Absolutely.

409
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:13.470
Yeah, absolutely.

410
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:18.330
Cameron Seay: Um, I'm sorry, I'm reading the know from john here.

411
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.220
Cameron Seay: John okay yeah good talking about

412
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.200
Rick Troth: Quit talking about go ball so much camp.

413
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:25.890
Yeah.

414
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:33.090
John Mertic: You can talk about Kobo all day long. Everyone else might leave

415
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.520
John Mertic: Well, okay, but let me

416
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:39.660
Rick Troth: Let me jump in and I was going to try and wait until the end of what cam saying but

417
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:47.820
Rick Troth: Please my parent company now is micro focus and when you know we we were we were with

418
00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:53.130
Rick Troth: At the time, HP and they spun off their software and at

419
00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:54.750
Rick Troth: One point we were even tied with Souza,

420
00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:07.620
Rick Troth: But HP spun off their software division to go merge with micro focus and a lot of people who was microphone. I knew micro focus was because I remember microphones cobalt from the 18th, which is still

421
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:11.100
Rick Troth: A substantial business. I mean, the

422
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:14.190
Rick Troth: The cobalt business within micro focus is huge.

423
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:26.130
Rick Troth: So, I mean, who doesn't get it for vendors IBM and IBM and then also IBM. No, no, let me not ragging on IBM micro focus has got a major cobalt business and it is not

424
00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:33.150
Rick Troth: To my knowledge, our compiler does not run on CEOs. It runs on Windows.

425
00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:35.490
Rick Troth: Linux Linux Ai x

426
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.040
Rick Troth: Linux Solaris Linux.

427
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:39.420
Rick Troth: And windows.

428
00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:41.100
Rick Troth: But

429
00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:44.160
Rick Troth: Personally I've used the new co ball and

430
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:45.900
Rick Troth: The micro focus cobalt compiler.

431
00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.860
Rick Troth: In the smattering of cobalt that I've done. So we've

432
00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:50.190
John Mertic: Got

433
00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:51.000
Rick Troth: We've got some

434
00:46:52.740 --> 00:47:00.960
Rick Troth: Some other platforms that are out there besides just the iOS and the IBM compiler. We've got a lot of cobalt stuff that's happening here. And one of the calls that we get

435
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:02.760
John Mertic: In my business with the data.

436
00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:03.660
Rick Troth: Protection stuff.

437
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:03.870
Joe Devlin: That

438
00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.370
Rick Troth: The stuff that I do is all

439
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:12.480
Rick Troth: format preserving encryption. I'm not actually in the cobalt business. So even though I'm talking about something from my employer, it's

440
00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:22.590
Rick Troth: Which kind of sounds a little self serving. I think there's just a huge opportunity to get some of the micro focus people involved in this form that you're trying to start up I will find them. We already know.

441
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.350
Cameron Seay: Okay, Britain's micro focus

442
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:26.760
Cameron Seay: There.

443
00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:30.600
Rick Troth: Okay, okay. Yeah, he's one I would mention. Great. Okay. You got him already good

444
00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.220
Cameron Seay: at math. Yeah, he's he's he's all over to my Twitter feed the notes on here.

445
00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:42.570
Cameron Seay: And that's pretty much all I had. I don't want to take up too much time with this, but, um, you know, I have this fleshed out for people that are interested in what we're doing.

446
00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:43.590
Cameron Seay: On the site.

447
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:49.440
Cameron Seay: Of there's a lot more information about you know what we're doing. But we want to provide skills and training and I'm working with.

448
00:47:50.070 --> 00:48:05.850
Cameron Seay: Some harshness arm of IBM who has the cobalt Fridays tightly coupled with her so that we don't work at cross purposes. So we want people we want to get it back into schools and anybody walking in off the street and wants to learn cobalt soup to nuts. That's what we want to provide

449
00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:08.370
Cameron Seay: We also want to see what the conduit or the industry.

450
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:14.760
Cameron Seay: We hear all these companies are using cobalt, but I don't see them ever

451
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.020
Cameron Seay: Asked for jobs. I mean, I don't see jobs come and I know everybody uses cobalt

452
00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:27.600
Cameron Seay: So I want to make sure that we know what industry is doing in industries onboarding process for cobalt skills.

453
00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:30.150
John Mertic: So that's pretty much all I have a man I'm I'm open for

454
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:36.150
Cameron Seay: Any questions, but that's pretty much in a nutshell, the, the, the GitHub repo will be updated as soon as possible.

455
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:38.640
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Yep, kiss. If we don't start trading cobalt

456
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:42.900
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Programmers what's going to happen is they're going to take the Cold War programmers that we do produce

457
00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.190
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): To convert cobalt

458
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.500
Cameron Seay: To some other application. Exactly.

459
00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:49.320
Joe Devlin: So I really like what you're doing.

460
00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.660
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Here and you know i i wish.

461
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.340
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): I don't know. I've heard more

462
00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:55.470
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Movement.

463
00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:56.550
John Mertic: And processing.

464
00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.300
phil tully: In this

465
00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:59.670
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Cobalt project that I have in the education.

466
00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.170
phil tully: prod project, which

467
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.670
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Is kind of disconcerting to me.

468
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:05.010
phil tully: But one of the things

469
00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:09.600
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): You mentioned high school and other things I've been working with

470
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:13.980
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): The Virginia cyber range, which is a system.

471
00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:17.250
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): For that all universities.

472
00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:18.900
John Mertic: Community colleges

473
00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.540
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): High schools and grade schools can use for cyber

474
00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.170
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Security

475
00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.840
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): One of the things I found is that

476
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:27.360
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): There's nothing for computer science. And I kind of feel like

477
00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:27.480
John Mertic: They're

478
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:29.610
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Putting the horse before the cart.

479
00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.240
John Mertic: Actually

480
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:31.050
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): We are now.

481
00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:33.180
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Involved in a National Cyber

482
00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:34.050
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Range.

483
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:38.160
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): And we're developing content for cyber security now.

484
00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.410
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): And we're working with NIST

485
00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.610
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): To do some of this stuff.

486
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.930
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): I'm thinking

487
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:45.540
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): God, I'd like to do what they're doing.

488
00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:49.230
John Mertic: In your space. In other words,

489
00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:52.650
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Get, get some high school people involved.

490
00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:54.390
phil tully: Teachers

491
00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.670
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Get some community college people involved.

492
00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:58.170
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): And do seminars with them.

493
00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:58.860
John Mertic: In other words,

494
00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:00.090
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): You know, work groups.

495
00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.310
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Because we do is we do work groups based

496
00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:02.820
John Mertic: Upon

497
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:04.740
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): You know, a white paper that says

498
00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:06.240
John Mertic: This is what industry needs.

499
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:08.820
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): And then we start creating content.

500
00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:10.890
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): That not only one university can use

501
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.360
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): But multiple universities.

502
00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:14.310
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): And we've got the sanction of

503
00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:15.420
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): The State of Virginia.

504
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.340
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): To create a digital certificate

505
00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:17.790
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): For

506
00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:18.900
John Mertic: Cyber Security

507
00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.820
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): It'd be nice to have something like that for

508
00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:22.080
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Cobalt as well.

509
00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:24.270
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): So I got my

510
00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:25.770
Cameron Seay: Boss.

511
00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:28.500
Cameron Seay: And I really appreciate what you're doing at VCU.

512
00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:31.770
Cameron Seay: Here's the thing though, we know the need is there.

513
00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:36.960
Cameron Seay: For some reason industry like keeps this. It's like there's they have cobalt

514
00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:39.780
Cameron Seay: Running on their on in the infrastructure.

515
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:46.770
Cameron Seay: I don't know why that is. But I asked him. I mean, Bank of America has like 50 million cobalt money. That's a lot of cool

516
00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.090
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Actually, I have

517
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:52.080
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): A Bank of America with their, their national data center is enrichment.

518
00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:57.090
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): And we've got context with them. I will approach them to see if I can't come up with a list of

519
00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:00.330
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Cobo related topics that they need education.

520
00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:00.510
phil tully: In

521
00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:01.890
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): And I'll approach them on that.

522
00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:03.960
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): So I can, I can get them.

523
00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:05.520
Cameron Seay: That's what we need, because what I

524
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.420
Cameron Seay: Found is

525
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:07.500
Cameron Seay: You know,

526
00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:16.470
Cameron Seay: You and I were strict instructors, if we really knew anything, we'd be making some real money instead of teaching it. But the institute from the students perspective.

527
00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:24.570
Cameron Seay: But you let a hiring manager at Bank of America fidelity say exactly the same thing that we said 100 times

528
00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:28.590
Cameron Seay: Didn't get resonance dinner. Dinner resonance

529
00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:32.670
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): And actually I don't I don't work for money anymore because my time is too.

530
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:34.770
Cameron Seay: Valuable hahaha. I like it.

531
00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:35.400
Cameron Seay: I like

532
00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:37.740
Cameron Seay: I like that.

533
00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.290
phil tully: Awesome, awesome.

534
00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.050
Cameron Seay: To tell them that you know we've all done this week.

535
00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:46.230
Cameron Seay: We did it because we enjoy teaching more than doing that before.

536
00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:48.990
Cameron Seay: But we've actually always have actually done

537
00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:49.410
phil tully: What we

538
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:52.170
Cameron Seay: Do, but we enjoy this.

539
00:51:52.410 --> 00:51:54.630
Cameron Seay: Week more qualms

540
00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:56.670
Cameron Seay: Then you know

541
00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:58.500
Cameron Seay: What you should go. I'm sorry.

542
00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:00.630
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): And then maybe the thing is not just

543
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:01.410
To teach the

544
00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:04.200
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Students but teach the

545
00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.280
Cameron Seay: Teachers. Yeah.

546
00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.430
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Because I think there's I know in university levels, there's

547
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:10.680
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): A FEAR OF mainframe.

548
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:11.910
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): And of course,

549
00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:16.020
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): You know when you bring up mainframe. They go over. We need 15

550
00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:17.610
phil tully: You know your

551
00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:19.680
phil tully: Old technology, you know,

552
00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:21.540
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): So I think it's a matter of

553
00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:23.700
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): You know, focusing the people

554
00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.720
phil tully: On the fact that

555
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:25.830
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): You know, this is still

556
00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:28.590
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): A viable and yeah

557
00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:29.520
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): I always tell him.

558
00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:32.160
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): It's not old technology. Yes, mature technology.

559
00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:33.750
John Mertic: Right. Right. Yeah.

560
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.820
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): But I'll take that as an action item to

561
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:37.020
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): You know, get with because

562
00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:39.360
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): My deans and

563
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.950
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): My foundation

564
00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:42.810
John Mertic: Are working very closely with Bank of

565
00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:43.470
phil tully: America.

566
00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:46.080
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): For this stuff. And I'll add this as a topic.

567
00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:47.100
Cameron Seay: Please do. Thank

568
00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:48.390
God

569
00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:50.490
John Mertic: Awesome.

570
00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:57.870
phil tully: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for this camp. I just started trying to get a temperature here with

571
00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:12.210
phil tully: This group here. It sounds like cam you're in a position where you would you say you're in a position where you have the proposal together that you would be looking for the tactic consider at this point as a formal Working Group, I do.

572
00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:19.560
Cameron Seay: I mean it's what's required for them to make a decision is what is in the GitHub repository. I have that

573
00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:20.850
Cameron Seay: I have that

574
00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:29.940
Cameron Seay: Now there's more, you know, just let me know what else I need, but I mean, I've got, I've got read the documentation. I just don't want to over. I know you're busy.

575
00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:31.290
Cameron Seay: And busy.

576
00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:35.190
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): But I, I like to see this as a project or a work group.

577
00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:38.280
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Because I think this could be a prototype for how educate the

578
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.570
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Education Project would

579
00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:40.290
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Go forward.

580
00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:40.770
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): You know,

581
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.830
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): And it's something moving forward I you know I

582
00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:47.520
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Like I said, we approve the education.

583
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:49.350
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Project. I think what

584
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:51.390
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Two three meetings ago

585
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:53.370
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): But I haven't heard anything from them.

586
00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:54.000
phil tully: Since

587
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:56.040
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): But this seems like something that

588
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.570
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): would fit into that or

589
00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.070
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Maybe be separate, but it's

590
00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.510
John Mertic: The same look and feel.

591
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:03.540
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): And I'd like to see some process move forward and

592
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:04.440
phil tully: It seems like

593
00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.480
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): We've got something going here.

594
00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:10.140
Cameron Seay: It can be a model. Yeah, it could be a model for what the academics should be doing.

595
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:14.790
Cameron Seay: Yep. But john me more. I mean, you know, I, you know, I'll give you whatever you need. I just

596
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:16.290
Cameron Seay: Following the two

597
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:18.510
Cameron Seay: Pretty meticulous I yeah

598
00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:21.000
John Mertic: No, no worries. No worries. I guess I'm looking

599
00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:22.980
John Mertic: For the moods and the

600
00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:25.020
John Mertic: From the attack here, Phil.

601
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:34.680
John Mertic: What are your thoughts. Do you think we should bring those quotes is just a just consider approve the concepts of doing work in groups and also this cabal working group.

602
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.110
John Mertic: That's fine.

603
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:45.240
phil tully: I mean, we've been talking about working group for a while. So this is not a bad idea to kick in with this one is the inaugural

604
00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:48.360
Joe Devlin: Since it has been

605
00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.070
phil tully: Already done around it.

606
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.410
phil tully: Yeah.

607
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:56.130
John Mertic: That's it's good to do stuff sort of with the windy are back here, for sure.

608
00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:01.140
John Mertic: I'll take that as a motion to approve the working groups program.

609
00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:08.220
John Mertic: And co the Kobo working group as a working group there. I hear a second

610
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:14.370
phil tully: Then

611
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:22.770
John Mertic: We'll try this vote thing again here. I'm all in favor eyes.

612
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:25.410
phil tully: Jai Jai

613
00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:33.660
Len Santalucia: Jai Radha. I didn't know if I should have seconded or voted, so I didn't do you want me to

615
00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:48.780
John Mertic: Alright, congratulations cam. You're the first working group in MP

616
00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:56.340
John Mertic: Worthy worthy honored one I'm

617
00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:05.700
John Mertic: Awesome. I know we're getting towards the bottom end of the meeting here. I think those are the two honking big ones just sort of spinning through a few of the other items here.

618
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:11.190
John Mertic: And then maybe opening up the tapes. The thing for any other projects that want to provide updates.

619
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:19.620
John Mertic: The adding plugins. I did see some discussion over the email list that there is a new maintainer interested in taking over.

620
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:28.530
John Mertic: I'm just waiting to see and hear feedback. And when that transition happens. So it sounds like maybe we

621
00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:33.300
John Mertic: sit back and wait to see where that goes.

622
00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:36.900
John Mertic: In terms of terms of decompress

623
00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:42.420
John Mertic: Peter, I think you were looking to follow up, did you end up hearing anything from that group, Peter.

624
00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:45.960
No I did not.

625
00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:47.430
Peter Fandel: Okay.

626
00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:57.600
John Mertic: Um, I don't know, in terms of the tack of how we want to proceed if if we want to search for a new maintain or put a search ads there for a new

627
00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:05.940
John Mertic: maintainer. If we want to put this into a narrative or sort of pointless to a future meeting. I don't know where Phil, what do you think

628
00:57:08.850 --> 00:57:12.450
phil tully: I don't see if there's someone actually interested in doing the maintaining

629
00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:16.500
phil tully: I mean, unless there's some pushback against them.

630
00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:19.890
phil tully: Or

631
00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:27.930
phil tully: I guess. Wait, you know what, since we should probably ask publicize it says anyone else looking to do it, but

632
00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:36.840
phil tully: That's. I mean, that's really it. It's, it's going to fall on the wayside and but somebody's willing to do it, then they should do so.

633
00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:41.100
Practical perfect

634
00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.470
John Mertic: They want to do it, they can do it.

635
00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.290
phil tully: Okay, um,

636
00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:56.100
John Mertic: So maybe we'll put a note out there that the projects, looking for a maintainer and see we can do. I know there's been a couple pull request that attainment lately and I know they've been kind of sitting there, so

637
00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:02.760
John Mertic: We'll try to figure that out. So I'll put a note out to the list and see if there's interest.

638
00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:06.360
John Mertic: The zero incubation renewal.

639
00:58:07.890 --> 00:58:17.760
John Mertic: I know we had kind of push this a little bit forward here and I see we have here in on the call. I believe as well here in a you are you still on the line. Yes, I am. And

640
00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:30.840
John Mertic: I don't know if you've had any more additional progress. I know there is a few things you brought to the tax in a previous call is there been any progress on on getting new folks engaged and sort of where everything fits

641
00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:32.760
Hiren Shah: Oh, I don't have

642
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.930
John Mertic: But

643
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:36.150
Hiren Shah: I got one new member

644
00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:37.110
Hiren Shah: Joining the

645
00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:51.480
Hiren Shah: The group. So I, I have one additional person in the group now. But other than that, no not not like the way we were hoping for, like, having with a community participating in, you know,

646
00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:54.150
phil tully: Collaborating with the workflows.

647
00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:55.500
Hiren Shah: But I am seeing

648
00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:59.100
Hiren Shah: More people getting it from the

649
00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:11.640
Hiren Shah: workflows from the horizontal repository. Right, so maybe they're not collaborating, but they, they are just learning from what we have put it into. So, so far.

650
00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:13.680
Hiren Shah: But I have seen

651
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:16.620
Hiren Shah: But other than that.

652
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.890
Hiren Shah: I have still a few things on my plate.

653
00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.700
Hiren Shah: To follow

654
00:59:20.850 --> 00:59:25.830
Hiren Shah: Follow me. I was out last week. So we have cancer. Last week's meeting.

655
00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:27.510
So for the next week.

656
00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.640
Hiren Shah: Project meeting, we will we will continue having this discussion.

657
00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:33.240
phil tully: About zero

658
00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:35.640
phil tully: Adoption. Okay.

659
00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:53.610
John Mertic: I guess in terms of the task here. I know. The question was, renewing the incubation status. Is that something that the tax at this point would want to consider, or what I guess, Phil, I guess I keep looking at you or the chairperson, what are you

660
00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:57.570
phil tully: If you haven't noticed I'm pretty

661
00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:04.500
phil tully: Relaxed on this, if somebody's wanting to do it. They should continue to do it so

662
01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.460
phil tully: I let somebody others in the tech take a different approach to this.

663
01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:13.950
phil tully: I just, I would renew them.

664
01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:15.480
John Mertic: All right.

665
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:23.760
John Mertic: I think that sounds reasonable dude right here. A second from anybody on the tack wanting for a renewal.

666
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:31.020
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): It sounds to me like they need some more time to

667
01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.500
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): You know, gain some momentum. Right.

668
01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:38.670
phil tully: Right, yeah. So that's why I'm suggesting

669
01:00:40.110 --> 01:00:42.510
John Mertic: That they run at their pace. Yeah.

670
01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:50.430
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): So the renewal of an incubation just means they're still getting their their their their momentum right so

671
01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.990
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Yeah, it's not like they're a formal

672
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.980
John Mertic: Project yet so

673
01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:54.570
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): I i would i would make

674
01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:55.410
John Mertic: It was a

675
01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:55.980
Mess.

676
01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.290
John Mertic: Yeah, well I'm gonna call Phil thing. It's a good ideas.

677
01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:02.850
John Mertic: Okay.

678
01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:04.410
John Mertic: All right.

679
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.680
phil tully: Then

680
01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:06.000
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): I'll second that them.

681
01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:14.400
John Mertic: Awesome. Alright, so for the third incubation renewal, do I. All in favor. Aye.

682
01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.940
John Mertic: Any opposed, or abstain.

683
01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.860
John Mertic: Motion carries. There you have another year. Thank you.

684
01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.130
Hiren Shah: Here in the team if

685
01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:35.700
Hiren Shah: They have

686
01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:39.300
Hiren Shah: Ideas, they want to participate, they're familiar with the CEOs.

687
01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.890
Hiren Shah: Operations and and they want to contribute and join

688
01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.050
Hiren Shah: The activity or here, I

689
01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:53.820
Hiren Shah: Welcome them and if you have any questions just reach out to me and we can work it out how to make progress.

690
01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:56.760
Awesome. Thank you.

691
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.820
Len Santalucia: So last

692
01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:05.640
John Mertic: Night of the agenda. And then on the project with dates and I saw Mike freezing agree you updated to get an issue in the back end.

693
01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:15.450
John Mertic: Around enabling GitHub actions for own P hosted projects that looks like that still moving forward on fail long not really any news to report yet, but hopefully for the next tech meeting.

694
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:19.920
John Mertic: So that sounds

695
01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:22.710
John Mertic: Awesome. Awesome. Thank you.

696
01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:37.290
John Mertic: Let's do a quick round of just project updates, maybe let's start with the graduated with Zoe and mentorship and then see if we have time, we can get also into the Miss other incubation any updates from Zoe.

697
01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:56.610
Peter Fandel: We had already. This is already said last week we had a good day successful program increment meeting cross-links cross, but that was great.

698
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:02.370
phil tully: Okay.

699
01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:03.960

John Mertic: All right, let's go to mentorship Bob any updates from that.

702
01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:20.130
John Mertic: Hold on.

703
01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:23.010
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): A minute. No, I guess.

704
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:23.850
John Mertic: No, I can hear you.

705
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.830
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Okay, good. Um,

706
01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:27.630
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Let's see, we're

707
01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:32.490
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Going to have a meeting for the midterms tomorrow morning at eight o'clock.

708
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.730
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Let's see, we've, it seems that things are going well, but

709
01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:39.540
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): I know

710
01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:47.610
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): We have one who's completed all their mid, mid term deliverables and we're going to release step into that one student

711
01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:52.560
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): The other students. We're going to make sure that they understand what the deliverables are

712
01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:58.260
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): We did that at the kickoff, but it's, it's, they may have questions in more detail.

713
01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:06.060
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): One of the things that we're looking at in the mentorship program is to we have 11 projects right now.

714
01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:08.640
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): We, we have

715
01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:12.930
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): That there's been a couple VCU is looking for

716
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:14.160
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Projects for the

717
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:17.760
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Next academic year. And I think there's

718
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.960
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Another one or two.

719
01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:21.810
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Universities are also looking for projects.

720
01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.260
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): So we thought we do is set up a

721
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:27.540
John Mertic: In the

722
01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:28.800
John Mertic: Get hub.

723
01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:31.230
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): For resources where we identify

724
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:33.570
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): What projects are in play and what are

725
01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.710
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): With the past ones where I'm going to start collecting

726
01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:41.430
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Projects as they come up. And as you think about them.

727
01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:45.750
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): From your sponsoring organ projects or organizations.

728
01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:47.610
phil tully: So that we have a list of

729
01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:50.640
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Projects that people can prop.

730
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.320
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Academics

731
01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:55.500
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): And other people could use if they're interested in doing a

732
01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:59.550
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Project. So with that, I'm looking for things like

733
01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:00.990
A tiny little project.

734
01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:03.270
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): You know the sponsoring

735
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:05.880
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Project that would be our organization.

736
01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:07.560
John Mertic: sponsoring the project.

737
01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:11.460
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): With the mentors could possibly be what their availabilities are

738
01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:13.860
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): You know and and

739
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:16.350
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Then what we would do is identify

740
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:17.970
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): That these are available for

741
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.110
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Either academic

742
01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:20.730
phil tully: Years or for mentor.

743
01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:26.430
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): summer internships. So the idea here is we want a stable of projects.

744
01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:27.990
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): As we go forward.

745
01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.620
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Instead of, you know, we have every year we go into

746
01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.590
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Looking for projects for the summer.

747
01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:38.310
